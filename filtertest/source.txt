Muiriel is 20 now.
I make â‚¬100 a day.
No one will know.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I love you.
Congratulations!
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
I don't speak Japanese.
I feel like playing cards. "So do I."
How do you spell "pretty"?
People from Madrid are weird.
Are they all the same?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you speak Italian?
May I ask a question?
These things aren't mine!
I have lost my wallet.
I'm tired.
I have a headache.
He would be glad to hear that.
I'm undressing.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
I'm thirsty.
It is raining.
How many times a day do you look at yourself in the mirror?
We went to London last year.
I have class tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
Thank you. "You're welcome."
She got sick this weekend.
Have you got a beard already?
I want an MP3 player!
Where are you?
I don't know him.
It's not important.
Better late than never.
Yesterday we had fun.
How much is it?
Don't forget the ticket.
I don't agree with him.
It's been ten years since we last met.
Do you know who he is?
You must study hard.
Do you keep a diary?
Who are you waiting for? 
Your examination results are excellent.
How is your work coming along?
I will do anything for you.
I believe you.
I don't agree with you.
It's not the time but the will that you lack.
The success resulted from your efforts.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I am not any more foolish than you are.
My life would be completely empty without you.
