We had such, potential. Such promise.
But we squandered our gifts, our intelligence.
Our blind pursuit of technology...
only sped us quicker to our doom.
Our world is ending...
but life must go on.
Wait, I'm a friend.
Yes. I always hoped...
so much thought...
The details, carved wood.
Molded copper.
You can't speak?
Ah'ha...
Come with me.
Here. Stop!
Some things in this world...
are better left where they lie.
But if you know where to look...
these ruins are full of riches.
Wait, wait.
Almost there.
Friend... friend?
- Friend. - Friend.
What's this?
You've found it.
He's... uh, he's always drawing this.
Are... are we alone?
No, no...
Go.
Get in the can, go on.
Hey, hey, hey...
Why don't you finish, what you started... with me.
No, no, no. No.
It's alright.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You're safe now.
Where am I?
With us. I never expected to see another one.
There... that should hold.
If Two were here, he would have done a better job.
- I wonder where he has gone to? - I was with him.
Two? Where, out there?
- What did he...? - Keeping secrets from me, I see?
I was coming to tell you.
What's this?
I found him, in the emptiness.
What were you doing out there?
You know the beast.
How many times have I told you?
The Beast? That's what took Two. If we hurry, we can save him.
The beast took him? That's the end of it.
But he was still alive.
No! We have rules!
Our new guest seems confused.
Perhaps I can help you teach some clarity.
- It didn't kill him? - Quiet.
Hold on.
When we woke in this world...
it was chaos.
Man and machine, attacked each other, with fire and metal.
I found others.
There's a gap ahead.
Follow me.
The gas... killed, everything.
I led us here...
to sanctuary.
and here we waited for the war to end.
Slowly the world, became silent.
The only thing that remains now...
is the beast.
So, we stay hidden...
and we wait for it to... to sleep.
But where did it come from? Why is it hunting us?
Questions like that, are pointless.
We need to protect ourselves. Keep ourselves out of danger.
Too many of us have already been lost.
But he isn't lost.
- Why aren't you listening to me? - Two, chose his own path!
I suggest you avoid making the same mistake.
Go to the watch tower...
and take our guest, with you.
This was the first thing we built together.
- We can still go after him? - Us?
But he could be anywhere out there.
Ah, that's where it took him.
Down towards those three tall shapes.
Oh, no! We can't! Not there.
We have rules.
- Why'd you listen to One? - A group must have a leader.
But what if he's wrong?
Come with me.
I can't do it alone.
I...
I... I can't.
But...
Wouldn't he have come for you?
Wait.
We're going to need a map.
Actually, I don't mind having one eye.
It's easier for me. I can concentrate on one thing at a time. You know?
Why was he out here alone?
- Where's this tunnel? - I don't know.
Wait!
We should go back.
We can't.
The, beast.
It's too dark.
We can use that.
Wait.
Two, would be impressed.
We'll find him.
You know, you're just like him. You forget to remember, to be scared.
Can I wait here?
Why would he bring him here?
Two!
Two!
I knew you would come.
I thought...?
- Seven? - I don't believe it.
- You've come back. - I never left.
You've finally decided to join the fight.
You dropped this.
Where have you been hiding?
Rusty and hectic gathered, shiny pile of scrap.
You did it, friend.
I never thought...
Wait. What're you doing?
You don't even know what it is.
No! Two!
Jump!
Hurry, quick.
What're you waiting for?
Keep running.
Come on.
I knew we should't have come. Why? Why did you do that?
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What were you thinking?
What's it going to do?
I know where we can find answers.
Is this, what it was like?
Keep up.
Oh, they've been here, the whole time?
Twins.
They've been hiding here, lost in the past.
Looking for answers.
They're cataloguing.
We need your help.
- We awakened, something.     - No, I awakened, something.
Something terrible.
That's it!
Today, the, chancellor presented the latest advancement...
of technological wizardry to the public.
Comrades!
Today begins a new era.
Let us praise this new technology.
Welcome, to the age of the machine.
It will make new machines, in it's own image.
Machines of peace.
NLetting us know the glorious new era...
of wealth and prosperity for the state.
Science has turned it's sinister eyes against us.
People of our mighty state.
Join me in repelling the iron fist of the machine.
But the thing that woke it, it... it was round and...
and engraved with strange shapes.
The shapes corresponded.
It fit perfectly, into the machine.
I think it was made for it.
That's what Six, always draws.
Six?
Two, collected his drawings.
He was always studying them.
- I have to see them. - What?
Go back to, One?
So he can lock us away, while this nightmare awakens?
Never.
Alright... alright, where did he put them?
Here somewhere.
Here. Here.
There they are.
Right?
You awakened, what?
You fools.
- I warned you. - He warned you.
Now you've awoke unimaginable, terror.
And may I ask, did you manage to save, Two? Of course not.
By following this wickless fool,
you've endangered everything we've worked for.
- Why was Two sent out, to begin with? - I sent him. To scout.
That doesn't make any sense.
You don't send the oldest out to... Look...
we need to figure out, what's going on.
The source... The source...
Go back, to the source...
This is it! This is what wakened the machine.
What do you know about this?
Now you can't be trusted.
I wont allow you, to endanger us further.
Subjugate them.
- Sub... What? - You illiterate crimp...
Take their belongings.
- Hey... - Wait!
You're nothing but a coward.
How dare you challenge me?
I, who kept everyone safe all these years.
Ever since you got here, everything has been unravelling.
You're a curse! A fool.
- Guided by pointless queries. - And you... are a blind man.
Guided by fear.
Sometimes fear... is the appropriate response.
No-o-o!...
- Nine! - Go!
- Nine! - Keep going, I'll find a way down.
Come on.
Let me try that again.
The cable! Pull it!
Grab on.
Grab the wire.
Your cape... let it go.
I can't.
Do it now!
It's only a cape.
There will be more, wont there?
Yes.
It's not safe here.
Stand look out.
I'll search out a safer retreat.
- What... what is it? - The source.
That thing that woke the machine.
- Go back, go back. - Back to where?
Dark science.
What good does this useless rubbish do us? Forget it!
You know something.
What do you know?
I know enough, to leave their ancient evil to moulder.
Look what they've left us with.
Leave it be I say. But you...
always asking questions.
So many pointless questions... Probing, pushing.
Like, Two, he always had to know, so much.
I was right, you did send him out to die.
He was old, he was weak.
Sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many.
You, coward!
Seven.
Your path takes us to catastrophe.
- We have to go back. - Back? Where?
To the first room, where I woke.
Can't he see, his way only brings trouble...
I mean what good comes from his part?
I know what we need, right now. I know what's right.
No.
No, no, you can't be.
No, no!
Find them.
Don't look in the eyes.
Five!
- Seven! - Nine!
- We have to go after them. - What?
- Eight? Wher... where's, Eight? - That thing has them.
It's taking them back to the machine.
Then it's too late.
Wait, wait, we have to get outta here.
We must try to find another safe place.
No more hiding.
We're going after them! All of us.
Need I remind you, on the outcome of your last heroic venture?
I can't let this happen to them.
- I'm going in. - I'm coming with you.
No... I need you here.
If I don't make it back...
destroy it.
Wait, How?
Come on, then. Let's hear it, what's your... brilliant scheme?
We'll need a full barrel.
Hey! Over here!
- Where are they? - It's been too long.
- We have to do it now! - No, they need more time.
Help me pull it down.
- They're coming. They're coming! - Help.
Help.
No! Not yet.
- Let go, you fool. - Five!
We're coming!
Now!
Good riddance.
It's done.
Thank you.
The machine, everybody! The machine! It's still alive!
No!
There's nothing we can do.
Help!
Please! No, no!
No!
It's not.
To the bridge!
No! They're trapped! They're trapped inside.
Six, come on! Get on the bridge.
No, stop! You mustn't destroy it.
Get away, Six!
You mustn't destroy it. Don't destroy it.
They're trapped, they're trapped!
They're inside, they're inside!
Come on.
Go back, to the first room!
He'll show you. The source.
- It must be destroyed. - No, no we can't.
Didn't you hear him? They're trapped inside.
- We can still save them. - What?
- How? - We have to find the source.
It holds the answers.
- We need to destroy it. - But there's still a chance.
We're out of time.
Nine...
they're gone.
You are wrong.
- Nine... - Let him go.
Greetings, Nine.
It had such promise, my great machine.
It was meant to be an instrument of progress.
of creation...
that was the agreement our, chancellor failed to honour.
But the fault is hardly his alone to bear.
The machine was born purely of my intellect.
Which I now know, was not enough.
My creation was hopelessly flawed and indeed dangerous.
It lacked a human soul.
and could easily be corrupted by those who controlled it.
That is why, I'm making each of you.
You're all that's left, of humanity.
You... are all the pieces of my soul.
Together, you and this device, shall protect the future.
Look closely and remember... what you see.
Fire!
I now know the truth!
The scientist.
It's the scientist. He's the source.
He gave us his soul.
We are him.
Load the cannon.
Stop! You'll destroy the talisman.
It's too late.
Quick, quick get in.
We need to take the talisman above the machine.
It can be used against it. lower it to me.
- Then you'll have a chance. - Enough, Nine, don't do this.
- What if you're wrong? - I'll show you how to use it.
It'll be okay.
This is the sequence.
No!
Please, we can't do this without you.
They all died because of me.
I started this, and now I need to finish it.
They left us nothing.
Nothing.
Why do we have to right their wrongs?
Sometimes, one must be sacrificed.
No!
You did it.
No... I didn't.
Not yet.
They're free now.
What happens next?
I'm not sure, exactly.
But this world is ours now.
It's what we make of it.
If I'm lying, I'm crying.
Mater, are you all right?
Oh, shoot, that was nothing. I used to be a daredevil.
-What? -That's right.
Folks would come from all around to see my stunts.
Mater! Mater!
Ladies and gentlecars, Mater the Greater!
Get your Mater teeth right here! Two buck teeth for one buck!
You're a hero, man!
And there he goes!
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through. Good to see you.
My bad. Hey, Ricky, how's the kid? Watch your hood!
He did it!
-Mater is greater! -You're the car!
I did all kinds of stunts.
Fire!
I busted nearly every part in my body.
But the biggest stunt Mater the Greater ever did
was jumping Carburetor Canyon.
Jumping Carburetor Canyon? No way.
Yes way, you remember. You was there, too.
What?
-Ready, buddy? -Ready?
All right then, get 'er done!
Well, what happened?
You didn't make it.
Well, see you later! Come on, guys, let's go!
If I'm lying, I'm crying. Gotta go.
Hey, Red.
-I used to be a fire truck. -What?
Dad gum right.
Fire! Someone call Rescue Squad Mater!
All units, all units! Please respond.
Fire in progress at one-two-zero-niner Car Michael Way.
That's the old Gasoline and Match Factory!
Right you are, Mater. Now go!
Chopper One en route.
-Trooper responding. Where's Mater? -Right behind you!
Mater One en route.
All right, back it up, folks.
Put it in reverse, pal. Make room for Mater.
Be advised, explosive situation.
Rescue Squad Mater, we're counting on you!
1 0-4! I'm on it.
Mater, I cannot believe that you were a fire truck.
You remember, for Pete's sake. You was there, too!
-Help! Help! -Remain calm!
-I gotcha! -Look out, it's gonna blow!
Get him to the hospital! Stat! He's overheating.
On my way!
Yeah, baby!
Paging Dr Mater. Dr Mater to the OR.
What's going on, ladies?
All righty now, let's have us a little look-see.
Mater, you're a doctor, too?
That's right, buddy. I got my MD, my PhD, my STP, and my GTO.
Hey, Doctor.
Clear!
-Well, what happened? -I saved your life.
What? No, you didn't.
-Did so. -Did not.
-Did so. -No, Mater...
-Yes, I did. Yep. -Mater, stop it!
-Did so. -Not! Did not.
Hello, Doctor.
Did so.
Don't lie, don't cry! Wrestle!
Check out the size of that monster truck.
Shoot, that boy's nothing.
I used to wrastle trucks bigger than that.
-What? -Yep.
I used to be a Monster Truck Wrestler!
Ladies and gentlecars,
introducing The Tormentor!
Excuse me, it's Tow Mater!
Who wants some ice cream?
The I-Screamer!
I'm gonna make you scream!
-Where did he go? -Excuse me, mister.
Can I have one double dip dipstick sundae, please?
Sure. That's a very popular flavour.
One, two, three. The winner!
Now that's a sundae, sundae, sundae!
-Drop and give me 20! -I'll give you three.
One, two, three. The winner!
The Rastacarian has The Tormentor in his signature dreadlock.
Me be jamming now, man.
One, two, three. The winner!
Who be jamming, now?
You be jamming, now!
Dr Feel Bad.
Your next stop is the hospital!
Don't worry, I'll bring you some flowers!
That's gotta hurt.
And just wait till he gets the bill.
One, two, three!
Paddy O'Concrete's gonna lay some cement.
Here comes a nice fresh pour!
Pour it on!
He got paved!
Now that's what I call a patio,
-daddy-o. -One, two, three!
You rock, man!
And now, the moment we've all been waiting for,
the buck-toothed wonder of the world, the wrestler of disaster,
The Tormentor!
Go get him, Tormentor!
And the world champion, Dr Frankenwagon.
Piece of cake.
And his Monster!
It's alive!
I'm dead.
What did you do?
Don't you remember nothing? We was a tag team.
-Tag, you're it! -What?
Yes, ladies, they are real. You wanna kick 'em?
-Quick! Tag me, tag me! -Tag.
Gotcha!
Watch this.
One, two, three.
The winners! The Tormentor and...
-What's your name, son? -Lightning McQueen.
And Frightening McMean!
Frightening McMean. Oh, please.
I can't believe it! The Tormentor!
I'm your biggest fan, man! Can I get your autograph?
-Well, of course you can. -I will never wash this door again.
Wait, don't you want Frightening McMean's autograph?
-No, thanks. -Seriously.
-I'm okay, really. -I'll do it real quick.
You're making me uncomfortable!
-Tag, you're it. -Tag, you're it.
-Tag. Tag! -Tag. Tag!
-Tag, you're it. Tag! -Tag!
If I'm lying, I'm crying.
-Hey, look! A UFO. -Mater, that was a hub cap.
No, it was a UFO.
And I know 'cause I done seen one once.
-What? -Yep, it was a crystal clear night.
Well, that's weird.
What... What the...
Well, hey there. Welcome to Earth. My name is Mater.
-My name is Mator. -Mator?
-Should I take you to my litre? -Your litre.
All right, then! Well, here's all my litres.
Man, that guy could put it away.
-Dad gum! -Dad gum!
We did all my favourite things.
I taught him how to drive backwards.
And he taught me how to fly.
Cool.
Wait up!
We're going to be best friends forever.
What?
-I got him. -No!
-Return to base. -Mator!
I'll save you!
Dad gum reverse.
I'm coming to get you, Mator!
Oh, no. Mator!
Maintenance to the loading dock, please.
Van, we'll meet you up there, come on!
Get me 10 men right here, on the double!
Private Smithers, come here right now!
Dr Schleppenwagen, report to Hangar 10.
Don't get too close.
-Everybody, say, "Cheese." -Cheese!
-Dad gum. -Dad gum? He's trying to communicate.
-Where is Dr Abschleppwagen? -Here I am.
So Herr Doktor, what does dad gum mean?
The dad gum means... Let's get out of here!
Dad gum.
Follow me, Mator!
Do you really expect me to believe that?
Well, you should. You was there, too!
It's beautiful!
Dad gum.
Thanks for saving us, Mrs UFO. You think you can drop us off at home?
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Mater, that did not happen.
Oh, yeah? Then how come I can do this?
Oh, Mater, please!
Far out.
If I'm lying, I'm crying.
Hey, look, bulldozers.
Yep. Them's just like the ones I used to fight.
-What? -That's right.
I was a famous bulldozer fighter in Spain.
They called me El Materdor.
Senor Materdor!
He's alive!
-El Materdor! -El Materdor!
Bravo, Senor Mater!
So there I was, surrounded. Bulldozers all around me.
-What did you do? -What did I...
Well, don't you remember? You was there, too!
What?
They sure liked that fancy red paintjob of yours.
Mater, that did not happen.
Well, try telling that to them there bulldozers.
-Seńor Mater! -Seńor Mater!
Senoritas!
Houston, if I'm lying, I'm crying.
Wow, check out that moon.
-Yep, I been up there. -You have not.
Oh, yeah, it's real purty.
It all started when I was towing this car to Florida.
And then suddenly, Houston had a problem!
Houston, I have a problem.
-He's stuck on the moon. -He needs a tow.
Where on Earth are we gonna get a tow?
Well, that guy's got a tow.
And with a little bit of training, I became a genuine auto-naut.
What's going on, ladies?
-Good luck, Mater. -The world's counting on you!
Welcome aboard, Mater. My name's Roger.
Well, howdy there, Roger.
Prepare for takeoff.
Let's burn this candle!
T-minus ten,
-nine... Main engine start. Seven, six... -Oh, boy! I've never been
-to the moon before, Roger. -...five...
-You'll love it. It's real nice. -...four, three, two, one.
Booster ignition.
And we have lift-off of Roger Shuttle on Impala XIII rescue mission.
I love my job!
We have cleared the tower.
It's all up to Mater, now.
Booster rockets 1 and 2 disengaged.
Roger, Roger. You are clear to burn.
See you later, Earth.
You are on approach to the moon.
Prepare for moon landing.
Open cargo bay doors.
Operation Tow Mater is go.
Okey-dokey.
Good luck, Mater. See you back on Earth.
Whoa!
Moon Mater has landed.
Thank goodness you're here, Mater.
Quick, connect your rescue apparatus to the frontal structural component
of the linear axle assembly. Pronto.
How about I just give you a tow?
Mission accomplished. Now, take us home. Rotate thrusters.
-Got it! Check. -Prime ignition.
-Pivot bolster columns. -What?
Disengage inertial dampener. Ignite propulsion system.
-Blast off! -Whoa!
Well, there I was, doing 17,000 miles an hour.
17,000 miles an hour? No way!
Yes way. But that was nothing compared to you.
Oh, yeah! This is awesome!
-Watch out for re-entry! -What?
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
Don't worry, I got you.
Yes siree! We was a couple of bona fide heroes.
So, Mater, when does an astronaut eat?
At launch time.
-Oh, come on. That did not happen. -Well, suit yourself.
-Mater! Houston has another problem! -Roger, Roger!
Let's burn this candle!
Oh, yeah!
If I'm lying, I'm crying.
Mater, why don't you get up there and sing?
-Nah, I don't want to steal the show. -Steal the show?
-Well, I was a big rock star. -What?
Yes, siree. I started out in a garage band.
Boy, we sound pretty good. Let's get a gig.
Don't forget to tip the waitresses!
-That so rocked! -I know!
-Do you guys have a record? -Do you guys have a record?
Be right back.
Oh, yeah!
What's that sound?
That sounds like angels printing money to me.
Say, you boys are good. All you need is a new name.
A new name? A new name.
Delivery! Where do you want this heavy metal, Mater?
That's it!
I wanna hear you.
-You were Heavy Metal Mater? -No. We was Heavy Metal Mater.
-Are you ready to rock? -Yeah!
Oh, yeah!
I'm sorry, Mater. That did not happen.
Well, suit yourself.
If I'm lying, I'm crying, see.
Morning, Flo. Hey, can I get some air? My tyres are going flat.
Flat tyres, you say? I thought I done solved that crime.
-What? -I was a private eye.
-No way! -Yes way.
It was 7:15 on a Friday night.
I was working downtown. Mostly small jobs,
but this time I was onto something real big.
It was all right there in black and white.
Blowouts everywhere. There was some kind of counterfeit tyre ring.
And a sale on trailer hitches down at Rusty Rod's.
l was about to hit the bricks, and then she drove in.
She was wearing those whitewalls, the ones that used to drive me crazy.
-Hello, Mater. -What are you doing here, Tia?
-I missed you. -Like you missed your last smog check.
You don't have to play poker with me.
Well, you always were the wild card. What do you want?
I need you to find my sister, Mia. She's been carnapped!
Quit the waterworks, will you? Where did you last see her?
She was working for Big D.
Big D, you say?
She worked at his club. The Carbacabana.
You wanted to see me, senor?
I'm looking for Mia. You seen her?
Mia! That ragtop. I don't remember.
Well, maybe this'll help you remember.
Maybe.
Well, now I remember.
I saw her a couple of days ago with Big D.
-Where did they go? -I don't know, and I don't care.
But she did smell salty. Like the ocean.
Hey, this guy bugging you?
Not yet, but a girl can hope.
Well, he's bugging me.
Whoa! Hello, Clyde. Where'd you get the hand truck?
You're a very nosy fella, kitty cat.
You know what happens to guys who shine their headlights
in the wrong places? No? Wanna guess?
-I don't know, free carwash? -No. They lose them.
Next time, it's the blinkers. Understand?
I was down to one headlight. But I could still see just fine.
Hey, Stinky? What's the dirt on the street?
-I don't know. -No?
No. They got me working the alleys, dumping all these blowouts.
-Blowouts, you say? -Yeah, it's odd though.
-Odd? -Yeah, they all have this smell.
-Smell? -They smell salty.
-Salty? Ocean? -Like the ocean.
I haven't smelled that since I worked down at the docks.
-Rocks? Ducks? -Docks. Docks.
The docks! Thanks, Stinky!
You're welcome, Mater.
Come on! Put a little hustle into it!
Big D! Wait till I tell the DA.
You ain't telling the DA nothing.
-What? I'm being shanghaied! -No!
Tia! You double-crossing double-crosser.
I had no choice. It was the only way to save my sister.
Well, you always did the right thing. Just the wrong way.
No!
What'd you do?
Like you don't know, Lieutenant Lightning McQueen.
Looks like we finally caught you, Big D.
-Get him! -Whoa!
Mater!
Whoa!
Just what I thought. Counterfeit tyres.
You led us right to him, Mater. Take him away, boys.
It was a fine mess you got me into, Tia.
I'm not bad, Mater. I just drive that way.
Come on. Let's pick up where we left off.
Mater, that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Come on, Mater! Everybody conga!
I'm right behind you!
If I am lying, then I am crying.
Morning, everyone. Sure is peaceful.
-Hey, losers! -Drifting through, baby!
Not in my town, you don't!
Get back here, you import punks!
Hey, go easy on them, Sheriff!
I used to be an import.
-What? No way! -Yes, way.
It all started when one day...
Hey, there, bud. Looks like you could use a tow somewhere.
Yes, but it is very far.
Well, shoot, no tow is too far for Tow Mater.
Man, I gotta change my slogan.
Well, here you go.
Domo arigato, Mr Tomato.
And a do itashi mashite to you.
What in the world?
Hello, ladies.
A whatsit?
He challenges you to a drift race!
-Drift race! -Drift race!
We will race at midnight.
Well, they seem friendly.
Mater-san, if you are going to win, you need modification!
-Modify! -Modify!
-Modify! -Modify!
Modify! What's that?
You look good, but can you race?
Can I?
Hey, can I?
Konbanwa, gentlecars. Let this be an honourable race.
You must race to the top of Tokyo Tower!
First one to seize the flag will become
King of all Drifters!
Well, what happens to the loser?
The loser will be stripped of all modifications
and become stock.
But I just got all this fancy stuff.
Ready?
Set-o!
Go!
You can't drift. You are loser!
I'll show you!
-Wrong way! -Look out!
Get back here, you import punk!
Look out!
Coming through!
Doughnuts! I love doughnuts!
Hello!
Good move, but not good enough!
Oh, no! Ninjas!
Whoa, ninjas? What did you do?
Well, shoot, you ought to know. You was there, too.
Lightning Dragon McQueen!
I'll take care of this. Dragon style!
Spinning dragon attack!
Oh, no! He's almost to the tower!
-Quickly, follow me! -Right behind you!
Look at me, I'm drifting!
Whoa, look out!
Oh, no! We're running out of road!
-No! I can't stop! -Then go!
Lightning dragon fireball!
Cannonball!
Victory is mine.
Well, hey. There you are.
Where did you come from?
I come from Radiator Springs.
You cannot defeat me!
-I can, too. -Cannot!
-Can, too. -Cannot!
-Can, too! Can, too! Can, too! -Cannot, cannot, cannot!
-Can, too! Can, too! Can, too! -Stop saying that!
I win.
No!
I'm stock!
And that's how I become Tokyo Mater, King of all the Drifters.
What? Mater, that did not happen.
Oh, yeah? Says you.
Modify!
Look at me! I'm modified!
It's said that the West was built on legends.
Tall tales that help us make sense of things too great...
...or too terrifying to believe.
This is the legend of the Ghost Rider.
Story goes that every generation has one.
Some damned soul, cursed to ride the earth...
...collecting on the devil's deals.
Many years ago, a Ghost Rider was sent to the village of San Venganza...
...to fetch a contract worth 1000 evil souls.
But that contract was so powerful...
...he knew he could never let the devil get his hands on it.
So he did what no Rider has ever done before:
He outran the devil himself.
The thing about legends is...
...sometimes they're true.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the amazing, blazing...
...stunt cycle spectacular!
How about a big round of applause for Barton and Johnny Blaze?
Let's hear it for them, folks!
You're a hotshot, ain't you, boy?
Young, think you know everything there is to know.
Think you're gonna live forever. Is that about right?
- Come on, Dad. It was a patch of dirt.       - That's not the point.
Point is, we've been doing this act less than a week.
You're already screwing around.
- I was just doing it for the crowd. - We both know why you done it.
You think she's gonna stand by you when you're in a wheelchair?
Huh, hotshot?
Son, everything you do in life, every choice you make has a consequence.
When you do things without thinking...
...you ain't making the choice, the choice is making you.
- You understand that?     - Yeah, sure.
What?
I said, "Yes, sir."
Hey, Dad, you think maybe I could take Grace for a ride sometime?
Think you're man enough for Grace?
Hell, yeah.
Well, I don't.
Hey, Johnny.
Hey, Roxie.
Go on.
Hey.
What's wrong, Roxie?
I'm leaving.
What?
My dad's sending me to live with my mom.
- When?      - Soon.
What about us?
He says you're not good enough for me.
That you're just a phase.
So what are we gonna do, Johnny?
We'll leave. We'll jump on the bike and just keep going.
But what about your dad? What about the show?
He doesn't need me. He doesn't need anybody.
Tomorrow, noon. We'll meet here.
What time is it?
It's late.
Where you going?
Nowhere, Dad.
I'm going nowhere.
Far out.
- Johnny Blaze.     - Yeah.
Caught your show today.
Just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed watching you ride.
Oh, thanks.
Perhaps you'd ride for me one day.
You run a show?
Greatest show on earth.
Thanks, but no thanks.
What's wrong, Johnny?
Worried about your father?
What do you know about that?
Even a blind man could see he's sick.
Thing about cancer is the time it takes...
...the toll on the loved ones.
Lives that are altered.
Plans that have to be changed.
Johnny...
...what if I could help your dad?
Yeah? How?
How is not important.
What if I could make him better?
Give him back his health?
Would you be willing to make a deal?
Name your price.
I'll take...
...your soul.
Okay.
By sunrise tomorrow, your father will be healthy as a horse.
And you will have your whole life ahead of you.
It's your choice, Johnny.
All you have to do is sign.
Oh, that'll do just fine.
Damn.
Morning, sleeping beauty.
Dad?
- You look...      - Great, right?
Least that's what the doc said when he looked at my x-rays this morning.
- What are you talking about?      - I've been sick, son.
When I finally get up the nerve to tell you about it...
...I'm not anymore.
I can't explain it. But I feel healthy as a horse.
Now, come on, hotshot. I got a show to do.
Biggest crowd of the week. Hey, you know what I was thinking about?
A new stunt. Put us over the top!
Be a jump: Me on one side, you on the other.
Instead of the cars or the ring of fire, a helicopter.
Yeah. That'd be pretty cool, don't you think?
Hey, you got two minutes to get in your suit, son, or you're...
Roxanne's dad is sending her away.
If we don't leave now, it will be too late.
Well, that's great, boy. That's great. Two kids on the run with nothing.
If your goal is to end up together, that'll make sure it doesn't happen!
I'd rather take my chances with her than to waste my whole life...
...jumping bikes at some stupid carnival.
Dad, I want something better than that.
Her old man will have the cops on you before you get to county line.
I guess I'd better get going then.
Hey, hotshot.
You take Grace.
At least you'll have a good head start.
Ladies and gentlemen, Barton Blaze!
Ladies and gentlemen, head for the exits.
Please stay calm.
Dad? Dad, it's all right, I'm here. I'm here, it's gonna be okay.
Dad?
Dad? Dad?
You're no good to me dead.
You. You killed him.
I cured his cancer.
That was the deal.
But I couldn't let him come between us.
You son of a bitch.
One day, when I need you...
...I will come.
Until then, I'll be...
I'll be watching.
Forget about friends.
Forget about family.
Forget about love.
You're mine, Johnny Blaze.
You can't live in fear.
You can't live in fear.
Johnny, Johnny!
Johnny Blaze!
Yeah, Johnny! Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen...
...please stay off the field to allow paramedics through.
Oh, God. Oh, God. JB!
JB, talk to me, man!
Heck, is the bike okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Bike's fine. Oh, God.
Thank you.
Let's go home.
Let's hear it for him, folks.
The amazing Johnny Blaze!
Johnny, you gave us all a big scare. What happened out there tonight?
Hey, JB don't do interviews, all right? I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Yeah, come on, come on.
Get the front end down. Damn it.
Blaze is down.
- Have you tried not crashing?       - Have you?
Why don't you have a beer and relax like everybody else, huh?
You know alcohol gives me nightmares.
To each his own.
Oh, wait, could you go back?
There's a howler monkey special on Discovery Channel tonight.
- Guys, hey.       - We've seen big moves and crashes.
But ask these riders who it is they look up to...
...and the answer's a man who's not even competing here, Johnny Blaze.
Yeah, that's because he's right here!
- Greatest stunt rider of all time...
...but what we don't know is how much longer can Blaze cheat death.
- Critics call it pay-per-view suicide...       - Put the monkey show on.
Mack, the monkey show?
With no regard for his own life.
They call him Mr. Invincible, and he'll have to be at his next jump...
...when Johnny Blaze will attempt to clear...
...the length of a football field from field goal to field goal.
What?
"What." You should be taking a dirt nap after that ragdoll today.
I got lucky.
No, I got a hunting dog named Lucky. He's got one eye and no nuts.
Luck don't cover it, JB. Man, you got an angel looking after you.
- Yeah, maybe.       - Mack, you in?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
Scoot over, ladies. What's the ante?
Five card draw.
Maybe it's something else.
There you go.
Took you long enough.
I think you might be lost, boy.
You deaf or something?
Angels only in there.
Angels. Really?
Yeah, really. You got a problem with that?
As a matter of fact...
...I do.
Yep. Love your neighborhood, Johnny.
Real friendly around here.
Oh, I see you still haven't gotten a lock for your lift. That's great, great.
You've got a lot of expensive bikes in here, I told you. How many times?
Well, JB, I said it before, I'll say it again:
This place could use a woman's touch.
- So could you.      - Heard that.
All right, four out of five. Wreck one more and you get the whole set.
Well, I'm glad to see you found use for your books.
You want some jellies?
No. I don't want none of your stupid candy.
I wanna talk to you about something kind of serious.
I'm trying to relax, Mack.
Yeah, I understand. All right? It's just gonna take a second.
It's about you jumping on the anniversary of your dad's accident.
Can I just turn this music off for a minute?
I want you to kick higher for me. Can you get higher?
This jump, man, we...
Come on! Hit it!
Mack, you touch the Carpenters or that chimp video again...
...and we got a scrap on our hands.      - This jump is nuts. All right, man?
I mean, field goal to field goal, and now you're adding cars?
I mean, what are you trying to prove?
That it's me.
That it's you?
Riding the bike.
Of course it's you, man. Who the hell else is it gonna be?
You know what, you're freaking me out.
You're freaking me out because you're reading...
...this comparative exponential religiosity crap.
It's getting in your brain.
I mean, what's going on, man?
Do you believe people get second chances?
L... I don't know.
If somebody makes a mistake, a big mistake...
...do you think that person should have to pay for it...
...every day for the rest of their lives?
Are you talking about your daddy's accident?
Well...
I'm just looking for a sign.
What kind of sign?
That I can take a negative and turn it into a positive.
That I can have a second chance too.
JB, what happened way back when to your daddy was not  your fault.
You know that, right?
Look, at least promise me you'll think about taking the cars out.
I'll think about it.
I knew you were here. I could smell your fear.
Hello, Gressil.
Why are you here?
Wallow.
And what do you want from us?
I've come for the contract of San Venganza.
Legend has it that the contract was stolen and hidden...
...in a graveyard not far from here.
And now you're gonna help me find it.
Abigor.
And when we find it, then what?
Then we'll take this world...
...one city at a time
Blackheart!
- What the hell are you doing here?      - It's my time now, old man.
Your time will come. But not now.
We both know you can't harm me here.
I'm not like you. I've never fallen. I never will.
I may not have power over you in this world, but my rider does.
The Ghost Rider?
Your favorite creation?
The power of hellfire wasted on a pathetic human?
If you had trusted me...
...if you had given me what was rightfully mine...
It's all mine. Until the end of days.
Go ahead.
Send the rider.
I'll bury him.
And then I'll bury you.
Father.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Johnny Blaze Leap of Death!
Yeah!
Johnny B!
Hey, JB.
You're stepping on Karen.
What was it you were gonna say, Mack?
I just ran a second check on the ramps. They look good.
Crowd's kind of out of control.
Johnny, you know you don't have to do this, don't you?
Does this suit fit all right? Feels a little loose.
Suit's fine.
Would you bring me my hat, Mack? Thank you.
You can't live in fear.
All right, we're up here on the right.
Mr. Blaze. Amy Page, event publicity.
- Have time for a quick interview?       - I don't know how long...
...you been doing your job, but Johnny Blaze don't do interviews.
Not even for an old friend?
Hey, Johnny.
Hi.
I'll do it.
Makeup.
He's good.
Oh, you're looking at the suit.
I know it's silly, but the fans like it, so I keep on wearing it.
- What about the cane?      - I need support.
No. It's part of the costume.
Okay, and ready in five, four, three, two...
How's your dad?
Johnny Blaze, thank you for talking to us before your big jump.
No one has ever attempted such a distance before:
Three hundred feet from field goal to field goal.
What's going through your mind right now?
You look really good. I've seen you on TV.
You know, I watch a lot of TV and you do a really good job.
Johnny, what drives somebody to risk their life for entertainment?
I heard you got married.
Oh, no. No, it didn't happen.
No?
Most of the time the press focuses on the crashes, the broken bones...
...the costs of what you do.
Are there any other costs?
- Commemorating this epic milestone...
...in the life of the world's greatest stuntman.
And remember, 40 percent of all proceeds tonight...
- Yeah.      - ...go to the Barton Blaze Foundation...
...dedicated to helping those in need here in our home state...
Okay, well...
Thank you for this revealing peek into the life of Johnny Blaze.
I'm Roxanne Simpson, on scene.
And we're out.
- You're gonna stay for the jump, right?      - You know, we gotta get back.
Plus, I never liked watching you jump.
Roxanne?
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you two had some kind of history.
That was it, Mack.
The sign.
The sign?
- Sure you don't wanna stick around?      - No.
It hasn't started yet.
I'll buy you a doughnut.
Come on, Roxie, it's Johnny Blaze.
Let's go.
Thank God you listened to me, took the cars out.
It would've been suicide otherwise.
This way if you come up short, see...
...you'll come down on some nice, soft, green grass.
...grass.
Johnny Blaze will not be jumping 50 cars today as scheduled...
...but instead will be leaping six UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.
Never before has any man attempted such a death-defying stunt.
I took the cars out.
Why? Why, JB? Why wouldn't you tell me?
- Because you would have thrown a fit.      - Call me old-fashioned...
...I'm funny that way. Human sacrifice makes me uncomfortable.
Why, JB? Why helicopters, man?
You know what I've been thinking about? A new stunt.
But instead of the cars or the ring of fire...
...a helicopter.
My dad thought it'd be cool.
- He was right.      - Yeah.
Okay. Okay. This is the deal, man.
Halfway down the ramp I want you to hit the NOS, okay?
Do not hit the NOS too early.
If you hit it too early, you are screwed. You got that?
Hey, JB, where's your head at, man?
She's probably on the interstate by now, huh?
How much NOS did you put in the tanks?
Enough to shame the space shuttle. Chief, go ahead.
Oh, God. He ain't gonna make it.
He made it!
I told you he'd make it! Yeah, JB!
Let's hear it for him, ladies and gentlemen.
Three hundred feet! A world record, as only Johnny Blaze can do!
Yeah! Yeah!
Where's he going?
I'll say one thing about the guy, he's got guts.
I mean, the other day I was watching this, like, sports show...
Stuart, can you please stop talking about Johnny Blaze already?
Yeah, that might be a little hard.
I made it!
- Pull over!       - Do you want me to pull over?
- Drive.       - Driving.
Come on, Roxie, I need to talk to you.
What's your name?
- What?      - What's your name?
Oh, Stuart!
- Johnny.      - Hi.
Well, Stuart, can you help me out here?
Sorry, dude. She's the boss.
Johnny, look out!
All right, I guess I see how it's gonna be. Hang on!
Howdy. Howdy, howdy, howdy.
Are you trying to kill yourself?
I wanna talk to you. I haven't seen you in 56,000 years.
This is crazy. You are crazy.
I don't have time for this, I have a story to edit.
You could have said no.
When they asked you to interview me, you could have said no.
- Move your van out of the way!      - What are you trying to say?
Well, I'm not trying to say anything. I'm saying that means something.
- Sorry!      - Don't mind them, they're fine.
We are on the side of the freeway.
Let's get some dinner. You still like Italian?
What's this about, Johnny? You want some closure?
Look, you were 17 and you witnessed a tragedy and you ran.
I understand now like I understood then...
...and I have no hard feelings, none.
That's why they call it the past, because it's passed. It's done, it's over with.
Too much?
There's a restaurant in my hotel, the Plaza. Eight o'clock.
Yes!
Don't be late.
This is a sign, Roxanne.
There are no accidents.
Destiny and all that.
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!
- Can you please sign my sister's book?      - Oh, sure.
- 300 feet.       - We love you.
Well, thank you.
Three hundred feet. Pretty neat, pretty neat.
Right on, Johnny.
Thank you.
You can't live in fear.
You can't live in fear.
You made that jump. No one else made that jump.
You're the best rider.
You deserve a second chance.
She's a sign.
Johnny.
Okay.
Johnny.
You.
Hello, Johnny.
Stay away from me.
Little late for that.
Nice bike.
Why are you here?
Oh, I've always been here, Johnny.
All along.
Phoenix...
...Denver...
...Houston.
It was you. Keeping me alive.
No. No, Johnny.
It's all you.
You're the best.
And I'm your greatest fan.
The posters, the video games...
...the crowds screaming, chanting:
"Johnny.
Johnny.
Johnny."
It makes me so proud.
It's like watching an investment...
...that keeps growing and growing...
...until the day you cash it in.
That day is today, Johnny.
Find the one known as Blackheart...
...and destroy him.
Find him yourself.
Doesn't work like that.
You're under contract, remember?
If you succeed...
...I'll return your soul.
Yeah, I'm not doing it.
You don't have any choice.
Hey.
You can't come in here. This is private...
...property.
There was a cemetery here.
Yeah, a long time ago.
What happened to the graves?
They moved them.
Where?
- I don't know.       - Who would?
Saint Michael's church.
They're in charge of the whole thing.
Look, you really shouldn't be here.
That's what they keep telling me.
God!
Looking for someone?
Back to hell.
We're not gonna have a meaningful conversation now, are we?
You're going down.
I don't think so.
He ain't so tough.
Hey. Dirtbag.
Have mercy.
Sorry. All out of mercy.
Help me!
Wait.
You think I'm pretty, right?
Oh, God.
Give me the damn bag!
Help!
Help!
Thanks.
You.
Guilty.
Look into my eyes.
Your soul is stained by the blood of the innocent.
Feel their pain.
No!
Give me your wallet!
Let me go!
Morning, bonehead.
- You all right?       - Yeah, I'm good.
I feel like my skull's on fire, but I'm good. Thanks for the water.
Did you see my bike?
Did I say something funny?
Ironic.
We're big on irony around here.
- It's out by the shed.       - Thanks.
It does.
What?
You're wondering if your bike looks normal? It does.
And to answer your other questions:
Last night did happen...
...it wasn't a dream...
...and it will happen again.
Who are you?
Question is, who are you?
You are the Rider. The Ghost Rider.
Get used to it, kid. It'll be a lot easier.
If you don't, I got a nice cozy spot picked out for you.
They've seen you now. They'll be waiting for you.
You'll need my help, you expect to last the night.
Last time I let a stranger help me it didn't pan out so good.
This ain't something you can run from, kid.
This day has been coming since you made that deal.
Congratulations.
Your chances just went from none to slim.
Sources close to the investigation say that there may be a link...
...between what happened here in downtown...
...and the Broken Spoke massacre in the desert.
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.
And we're out.
- Captain Dolan.       - No comment.
Is it true they found a connection between the massacre...
...and last night's victim here at the city train yards?
No comment.
Off the record, captain.
Off the record?
Piss off.
The Rider is the devil's bounty hunter.
Sent to hunt down anyone that escapes from hell.
Sterilize that for me.
Sterilize.
In the boiling water.
Right. Okay.
Little confused.
During the day you'll be normal.
But at night...
...in the presence of evil the Rider takes over.
I remember now.
Last night.
There was some punk...
...and I could see all the wrong he'd ever done...
...and I turned it all against him.
The Penance Stare.
It sears the souls of the wicked.
It's the Ghost Rider's greatest weapon.
All the Riders have it.
Have there been others with my "Ghost Rider" problem?
Been a few.
Last one was 150 years ago...
...in a little town called San Venganza.
Nice town.
Nice people.
Till a stranger came along making promises...
...one deal at a time.
Consumed by greed, they turned on one another...
...until the village of San Venganza drowned in its own blood...
...their souls trapped forever in that godforsaken place.
What's this have to do with Blackheart?
Blackheart?
He sent you after Blackheart?
And others.
The Hidden.
Fallen angels cast out of heaven by Saint Michael himself.
They hide within the elements waiting for the end of days.
You better hang around here, kid.
They can't come onto hallowed ground.
Thanks.
And thanks for the info.
I feel much better now that I know I'm the devil's bounty hunter.
- Where you going?       - Somebody I gotta see.
That's a bad idea.
Wouldn't be my first.
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you make the deal?
I was a kid.
What'd you get in return?
Heartache.
Captain. Captain!
Forensics on the bikers and the station manager...
...suggest the same cause of death.
Sulfur poison?
- I didn't think sulfur was toxic.       - It is, in massive doses.
And these guys were swimming in it.
Could be the work of a chemical attack.
Or a religious nut.
Hey. I know you. I've seen...
Okay? There's nothing here to suggest any kind of religious m.o.
- Sulfur?       - What about it?
Ever read the Old Testament?
Brimstone.
There you go.
Oh, my God.
It's hard to describe the destruction here this morning.
Can I get you people to stand back, please?
I don't know. It seems like something supernatural.
Could you tell us about the Good Samaritan?
Well, I'll never forget him, that's for sure.
He was tall, broad shoulders, and thin, really thin, like bony.
And he had this rad chopper, it was all flames and stuff.
Oh, and his face was a skull and it was on fire.
"On fire."
Yeah, like:
Like that much fire.
And I know it sounds weird, but it looked okay on him.
I mean, it was an edge look but he totally pulled it off.
Not sure what to add to that.
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.
Thanks.
- Roxie...      - Don't.
Now, hold on a second. Let me apologize.
- Last night was inexcusable.      - No apologies.
See, you did me a favor last night...
...because you made me think of then and now.
And when you left, yeah, it hurt like hell.
But you know what? I got over it...
...and I went to college, I got a great job.
But you, Johnny...
...you're just the same.
Oh, better paid, more fans...
...but you're still just a carny.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
My dad was right.
You were just a phase.
That went well.
Hey, captain! I got something.
"End of days.
The host can gain control of the possessing spirit...
...through concentration on and manipulation of...
...the fire element that exists within man."
I am speaking to the fire element within me.
Give me control over the possessing spirit.
- Hi.       - Hi.
Hey, I hope you don't mind. Your lift was open.
I came to apologize.
I'm leaving town tonight...
...and I didn't want what I said today to be the last words between us.
- That's okay.       - No, it's not.
It was cruel and totally untrue.
And I feel really terrible about it.
Please, don't. It's okay.
Is something burning?
Oh, that must be coming from outside. Neighbor's hibachi.
Bill, he just got it.
I still have that one.
You what?
I have that one, too.
I remember that day.
There were a dozen people waiting in line...
...and you went through a whole roll of quarters.
Look at my face. You can tell I was just terrified...
...that my dad was gonna come in any second.
Okay, I just...
It's just... I think I should walk you to your car.
See, it's not great timing.
You almost kill yourself on the highway...
...so you can ask me out and then you don't show.
Then you keep my picture...
...but when I kiss you, you try to shove me out the door. What's...?
What's going on?
Don't you care about me at all, Johnny?
You know you can talk to me. You can tell me anything.
Please.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.
Try me.
You'll think I'm crazy.
Maybe I am crazy.
I hope I'm crazy.
In my job, I've seen and heard just about everything.
So there is nothing you can tell me that's gonna surprise me.
Off the record?
Yeah.
I sold my soul to the devil.
And now I have to spare you.
Spare me from what?
The devil, on account of I work for him.
That's why I couldn't make it to dinner.
Because you were working for the devil?
Well, yeah. I'm his bounty hunter.
But it only happens at night, like it is right now.
Whenever I'm around evil.
Evil people, evil spirits. I change into...
What?
Just a great big monster, but I am learning to...
I'm getting control of it.
I'm trying to.
So tonight, you'II...
I believe so.
Which is why it's probably a very good idea...
...that you run on home now, Roxie.
You're serious.
So this is your excuse?
For the past? For last night? For everything?
The way I see it is I've got a couple of choices:
I could either accept that you really believe what you're telling me is true...
...and take you to the nearest psychiatric hospital.
You see, now that...
Or I realize that you'd rather make up ridiculous stories...
...than be honest with me...
...and I walk out of that door...
...forever.
- Don't move!         - Hands up!
Hands where we can see them! Right over your head.
Johnny Blaze.
Yeah.
Captain Jack Dolan. This is Officer Edwards.
You're coming with us.
Okay.
Let's try this again.
We have your plate and the tread from your tires at the crime scene.
We have a witness who will testify...
...that the suspect used some kind of fire effect.
An effect just like the ones that you use in your stunt shows!
Yeah. But I told you, I didn't kill anybody.
- What about him, you remember him?        - No.
This guy was three years from retirement...
...never harmed a fly.
In fact, neither did most of the corpses turning up...
...since you came home, you son of a bitch.
- I didn't kill anybody.       - Bullshit!
Okay, let's take a breather.
- It's warm in here. - Warm?
Yeah, I'm burning up. Aren't you?
A little.
You want a cigarette?
Okay.
Mind if I do?
Okay, that was weird.
Look, Johnny, I'm not asking for your help.
I'm asking you to help yourself.
I watch a lot of TV and I know what you're doing.
Good cop, bad cop. But you're both good cops.
And you provide a very, very important civil service.
In fact, when I finish my stunt career...
...I intend to apply my skills to being a motorcycle policeman.
So I'd love to help you. But I didn't kill anybody.
Jesus Christ.
Who you trying to convince, Johnny? Us or yourself?
We're trying to help you here.
We're trying to keep this thing quiet.
Yeah, because I imagine that your fans wouldn't be too keen...
...on you being wrapped up in a homicide investigation.
Not to mention all those corporate sponsors, event promoters...
You ready to talk now, Johnny?
Or do you want to spend the night in the tank?
Oh, I don't wanna do that.
No, sir. I sure don't wanna do that.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Damn it!
You gotta let me go. The real killer's out there.
- Lookie here.        - But you're making a mistake.
What've we got?
Come on, move your ass!
Blaze, riding up to meet us.
Oh, God. Oh, please. Please, you don't wanna put me in there.
Sorry, the Ritz was booked.
Oh, God. Please, get me out of here!
You look like that Johnny Blaze.
Yeah, yeah, I hear that a lot.
Nah, that is you.
- That's him!        - Yeah, it is.
I saw you jump in the state fair a few years ago.
I paid 10 bucks to watch you splatter.
But you didn't.
Looks like somebody's tripping out.
You might be a big shot out there, Blaze...
...but in here you're nothing but a monkey in a cage!
Now, I don't want any trouble.
I don't want any trouble.
Looks like trouble just found you.
Nice jacket.
Come on, man, leave him alone.
Get lost!
- The jacket's mine.       - Stop it!
Nice jacket.
Very nice.
You.
Innocent.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
I've sinned a lot.
Hold it!
Where's the contract of San Venganza?
I don't know what you are talking about.
Don't lie to me! You've been protecting it all these years, sworn to secrecy.
Sworn to keep it from the likes of you!
There's an old saying:
"Raise no more devils than you can lay down."
My father raised one too many.
Calling all units. Reported 10-50 in the downtown area.
Proceed with caution.
He's coming for us.
Abigor.
You know what to do.
Rider.
I have a suspect fleeing west on Cherry. Repeat, west on Cherry.
- That's a dead end. You got him.       - 10-4 on that.
What's the suspect's location?
- Up.        - What?
The suspect is going up.
Oh, my God.
Go, go, go!
Surround him! Make a perimeter! Let's go!
- Come here!        - No!
You're pissing me off.
Okay, okay.
Sorry.
Take a right.
You should've joined us, Rider.
Soon we will have the contract...
...and then you'll only be a footnote in the history of the new hell.
Time to clear the air.
You're a slow learner, aren't you, Rider?
You cannot catch the wind!
No!
Oh, my God.
Johnny.
Prepare to fire!
- Fire!       - Don't!
They know who I am.
- Who's that?        - What? Everybody.
You don't watch TV? What's the matter with you?
Is this thing ever gonna end?
It'll end if you can catch him.
What's really going on?
- Anything good on?      - How can I help you, captain?
Get out.
We brought a friend of yours in for questioning last night...
...and now he seems to have disappeared.
Has Johnny Blaze tried to contact you in any way, ma'am?
Sorry. Can't help, guys.
Look, I don't pretend to know what the hell that thing is...
...but I do know that Blaze is wrapped up in it.
And the only way you can save him now is if you help us find him.
You got six hours. After that we go public with everything we got.
Six hours.
"Carter Slade."
Legend has it he was a Texas Ranger. Man of honor.
But he got greedy.
Found himself locked up, waiting on the gallows.
Stranger came to see him.
Offering freedom.
Slade made a deal.
Ended up a Ghost Rider.
What's he gotta do with this?
Remember that contract the stranger made with the people of San Venganza?
The story goes that Slade was sent there to collect all the souls.
But what he found there was so evil...
...that he took the contract and rode off.
He stole it.
Keep Mephistopheles from getting his hands on it.
Some people say he was buried with it.
- Was he?       - I don't know.
What I do know is that Blackheart is coming, and he'll do anything to get it.
That's why it's important for you to stay away from friends and family...
...anybody he can use against you, because he will.
Roxanne.
Johnny?
Johnny?
God!
Sorry! Sorry!
Ma'am, you gave me a start.
- I'm looking for Johnny.       - Yeah. You and me both.
- Have you heard from him?       - No.
But I heard he got in trouble.
He got arrested, yeah? What for?
Yeah, well, if this gets out in the press, his career is over.
Yeah, trust me, his career's the least of it.
You know, you seem like a nice lady, and you're pretty and all...
...but we were riding the gravy train on biscuit wheels...
...then you showed up, everything went to hell.
So why don't you go back to wherever it is you came from?
I can't go back. Not now.
Then tell me what the hell's going on!
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Look, you don't know me...
...but I love him.
So if there's anything you know that can help, anything...
Lately, he's been reading these really weird books...
...and they're messing with his mind.
He's writing stuff down and staying up late. And he does it over here.
You can go through this stuff, and I don't know if it means anything.
This is hallowed ground.
Did you think I was like the others?
I have all of my father's strengths and none of his weaknesses.
The new hell is in San Venganza.
I need the contract.
I know it's here.
Now give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me.
You're gonna fall.
Just like your father.
The Rider, where is he?
Gone!
The girl.
You hurt her, he'll be there like lightning before the storm.
I'm counting on it.
Where's Roxanne?
Dude. Where've you been? Everybody's out looking...
- Where is she?       - She's out looking for you.
Jesus.
Not even close.
You have his heart.
Now I'm gonna break it.
Roxanne?
Mack.
Roxanne.
Look into my eyes.
Your Penance Stare doesn't work on me.
I have no soul to burn.
I guess the Caretaker forgot to mention that, huh?
Surprise!
He sent you to bring me back.
I'm not going back.
I like it here.
He thinks you're better than me?
I don't know who's more pathetic, you or him.
Now, listen to me. And try to get it through that thick skull of yours.
You don't work for my father anymore. You work for me.
Get the contract from the Caretaker.
Bring it to me in San Venganza and maybe I'll spare your girl's life.
And, Johnny...
...don't make me wait.
What happened?
- Blackheart.        - They got her.
Where's the contract? I can't end this without it.
Just gonna have to dig this whole damn place up myself.
It's not there, kid.
Contract of San Venganza.
Hell on earth.
Now, you're gonna have to trust me.
And why is that?
He may have my soul...
...but he doesn't have my spirit.
Any man who's got the guts to sell his soul for love...
...got the power to change the world.
You didn't do it for greed.
You did it for the right reason.
Maybe that puts God on your side.
To him, that makes you dangerous.
Makes you unpredictable.
That's the best thing you can be right now.
San Venganza's 500 miles from here.
We better get moving.
"We"?
I got one last ride left in me.
Carter Slade.
Can you keep up?
Let's ride.
Stick to the shadows.
This is the end of the trail for me.
I got nothing left.
I could only change one more time, and I was saving it for this.
God knows I've made my share of mistakes.
Been trying to make things right ever since.
Guess all I can do now is hope he sees fit to give me a second chance.
Thank you.
No.
Thank you, kid.
The Rider is coming.
Coming to save you.
You think you can stop him? Nothing can stop him.
He's running out of time.
I'll make sure of it.
It's almost dawn. Slow him down.
- What?       - Slow him down.
Surprise.
Stop.
You change, she dies.
Do it, Johnny.
Let her go first.
Looks like you're out of time.
"This is the contract of San Venganza.
All of you...
...come to me!"
Johnny!
My name is Legion...
...for we are...
...many.
Let's go. He got what he wanted.
You go. I gotta get him to the shadows. I gotta end this.
Why? Why you?
It's been me since the day I made the deal.
I'm the only one who can walk in both worlds.
I'm Ghost Rider.
Run!
Come on, you son of a bitch.
All of your world...
...all of your souls...
...will be mine now.
- Throw me the gun!       - It's out!
Throw it!
How does it feel to have all that evil inside of you?
All their power.
All their souls.
A thousand souls to burn.
Look into my eyes.
Your souls are stained by the blood of the innocent.
No.
Feel their pain.
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Kill you!
Stop it!
Oh, God!
Monster.
I'm not afraid.
Congratulations, Johnny.
You upheld your end of the bargain.
It's time I take back the power of the Ghost Rider.
You get your life back.
The love you've always wanted.
You can start a family of your own.
There are more deals to be made.
More people willing to give their souls for what they desire.
Let someone else carry this curse. You're free now.
After all...
...a deal's a deal.
No.
I'm gonna own this curse...
...and I'm gonna use it against you.
Whenever innocent blood is spilt...
...it'll be my father's blood...
...and you'll find me there.
A spirit of vengeance...
...fighting fire with fire.
I will make you pay for this.
You can't live in fear.
No!
So where will you go now?
Wherever the road takes me, I guess.
My daddy once said, "If you don't make a choice, the choice makes you."
Yeah. But why do your choices always keep us apart?
Sure wish things could have turned out different.
No. This is what you are.
This is what you always were meant to be.
You got your second chance.
Go out there and make the best of it.
It's said that the West was built on legends...
...and that legends are a way of understanding...
...things greater than ourselves.
Forces that shape our lives.
Events that defy explanation.
Individuals whose lives soar to the heavens...
...or fall to the earth.
This is how legends are born.
[Film reel whirring]
[Man] Red Riding Hood, you probably know the story.
[Girl screaming]
But there's more to every tale than meets the eye.
It's just like they always say, you can't judge a book by its cover.
If you want to know the truth, you've gotta flip through the pages.
Granny!
It's me, Red!
Is everything OK?
Oh, yeah, sure thing. Come on in.
What?
- Who are you? - I'm your grandma.
Your face looks really weird, Granny.
I've been sick. I...
Your mouth doesn't move when you talk.
Plastic surgery. Grandma's had a little work done.
Now, come on over here. Let's have a look at you.
So, what's going on, Grandma?
This and that, doing a lot of quilting.
So you got the loot?
Whoa. What big hands you have.
Oh, all the better to scratch my back with.
- And what big ears you have! - All the better to hear your...
...many criticisms!
Old people just have big ears, dear.
And Granny, what big eyes you have!
Are we just gonna sit around here and talk about how big I'm getting?
You came here for a reason. So tell old Granny what you got in the basket.
Ah, Granny! What bad breath you have!
- All right! - Ah!
You again? What do I have to do, get a restraining order?
Settle down, little girl. I'm on to you.
- Hai-ya! - Save it, Red Fu.
You been dodging me all day, but now you might as well give up.
Ahh! [gasping]
Ha!
You crazy wolf! What have you done with Granny?
I'm taking Granny down, and you're next!
- [Red] Granny! - It's you! But you...
- [glass breaks] - [All screaming]
[Sirens blare]
[Helicopter blades whir]
[Siren wails, tires screech]
[Reporters clamoring]
[Reporter 1] Chief Grizzly, are the suspects
- connected with the Goody Bandit? - Yeah, uh...
No. Don't print that, Maxine. We don't know anything yet.
[Reporter 2] Is the house made of gingerbread?
- Don't think so. - Do bears eat gingerbread?
That's enough with the questions. Jerry, come on! Get these people back!
All right, back it up! Let the chief do his job!
Come on, you, with the feathers, back behind the snake.
I just want to go home and hibernate.
- Bill! - Chief!
- All right, what do we got? - It's a domestic disturbance.
Breaking and entering, wielding an ax without a license, intent to eat.
I get it. Any connection with the recipe robberies?
You mean the Goody Bandit? Could be. The house belongs to Granny Puckett.
- The cookbook lady? - Yeah, that's the one.
[Chief] Hmm.
OK, Paul Bunyan was swinging the ax, and Wolfie was trying to eat Lil' Bit.
- All right, get a muzzle on that guy. - I can explain everything.
You can explain it to the judge.
- Shouldn't you be in school? - Shouldn't I have a lawyer?
Uh... What are you doing?
- Hey. We was just... - I was just smelling it.
- Don't eat that. That's evidence. - Right.
[Roars]
All right, so this looks pretty open-and-shut.
Little Miss Rosy Cakes making covert deliveries to the goody tycoon,
Wolfie tries to eat 'em both,
then Crazy Flannel Pants with the ax here busts in swinging vigilante-style.
Take 'em downtown, boys.
It's the woods, chief. We don't have a downtown.
You know what I mean. Just book 'em!
[Male voice] Not so fast, Grizzly.
That's the problem with you bears, always growling up the wrong tree.
- Hey, Nicky! - You on the case, Nick?
No, just stopping by to have a sarsaparilla.
Say, Tommy, you lose some weight?
- Uh, no. - Didn't think so.
Nicky Flippers. What are you doing here? This is my case.
Well, someone hibernated on the wrong side of the cave.
I saw the lights, thought the circus was in town.
Now, of course, I see I was right.
You're too late, Nicky. I got this case all wrapped up.
- Is that right? - Yeah.
[Red] They got us all wrong, Mr. Flippers.
Oh, I don't know, you look pretty dangerous to me.
- What's your name? - Red.
- And why do they call you that? - Why do they call you "Flippers"?
[Dance music plays]
Go Flippers
- Jump! Get on! - Go Flippers
Go Flippers Go Flippers
- [cheering] - Uh, no reason.
They call me Red because of this red hood I wear.
- What about when you're not wearing it? - I usually wear it.
Recipes have come up missing all over the forest.
Goody shops have been going out of business for months,
and the trail ends here. I got a case to close.
Slow down, chief. We've got four suspects, and that means four stories,
and if you get people talking long enough, someone will spill the beans.
- [Snorts] Beans? - Could I just make a quick phone call?
Aaah!
I'll tell you what happened.
What's with the handcuffs on a girl? Her wrists could slip right out.
- How about a cage? - Bring in the cage!
- I was being sarcastic. - Sarcasm. Strike the cage.
[Chief] All right, get the cuffs off her.
[Pencil sharpener whirs]
So, Red, why don't you explain how this all began?
Well, like any other day.
I was making deliveries for my Granny's goody shop.

- @ I know - Hi, Red!
@ It's a tired old tale but it still rings true

Hey, Red!
Oh! Nice outfit. Always red with you.
- You must be in autumn. - Hey, Boingo.
Aren't you helping the Muffin Man today?
Oh, he closed up shop. Someone took all his recipes last night,
and now I'm out of a job.
Gee, Boingo, I'm really sorry. Are you still running the cable car?
Yeah, yeah, I am.
But it's nothing like making goodies all day.
Would a carrot crumpet make you feel better?
Oh, boy, oh, boy! Thanks, Red. I can always count on you to deliver,
you little rascally devil.
Yeah, well, the woods don't go around by themselves.
[Door closes]
Shut it down.
[@ Daniel Rogers: Little Boat]
- Come on, let's go. - Where are we going now, Mama?
[Red] With the Goody Bandit on the loose,
recipes were becoming an endangered species.
I decided to call Granny.
If anyone would know what to do, she would.
I don't know what to do. I'm just a tired old lady.
Your recipes are the most famous in the whole forest, Granny.
What if they get swiped? It could wipe you out.
Maybe I should bring you the recipe book, for safekeeping.
A trip up the mountain is too dangerous for a little girl.
I'm not so little anymore.
Please, dear, you just keep the recipes there, and everything will be fine.
- But... - I have to go now. My program's on.
- Kisses. - [Sighs]
What you reading, Red?
"Far Away Places"?
- Are you going somewhere far away? - No. The world is too dangerous.
Can't see! Danger! Turn into the skid!
[Tires screech, crash]
[Duck] I'm OK. I'll walk it off.
You can't go away. Who's gonna ride the Goody Bike?
If I had wings like you, I'd fly all the way past that mountain,
and the next one and the next one...
But I can't. I'm just a kid.
I'm just a woodpecker.
- [Glass shatters in distance] - Uh-oh.
[Grunting]
[Woodpecker] "You're next"?
What... what does it mean, "you're next"?
Ruined.
It means someone wants our recipes.
Are they gonna get your recipes?
Not today.
[Nicky] So you deliberately took your Granny's recipes
from the family vault, without permission.
- Help yourself. - And then,
you set out on a dangerous journey up the mountain...
...alone? - Yeah. I guess I did.
[@ Todd Edwards: Critters Have Feelings]

@ Well, critters have feelings

[Boingo] I guess running the cable car's not so bad, you know.
It's a great way to see the forest without worrying about all those big,
mean, hairy beasts out there.
- Beasts? - Oh, yeah, you know, beasts.
The wolves and the bobcats and the mountain lions
and the saber-tooth tigers! But mostly wolves.
- Mostly wolves. - [Howling in distance]
The forest can be a dangerous place for a little guy like me, with my cute...
Look at me, I'm fuzzy... You deliver up this far?
Well, not usually.
But I was thinking about what you told me earlier.
About the Muffin Man?
I need to protect Granny's recipes from that Bandit's evil plan.
They're gonna shut down everyone in the forest if we're not careful.
Aaah! Aah! Aah!
- No! - Aaah!
Ohh!
Aah! Whoa! Ohh!
Aaah!
[Moans]
- [Growling] - [Whimpers]
- [Gasps] - 'Afternoon.
Hello.
So you're the little girl in the red hood.
That was quite a bit of falling you did just now.
- You saw that. - Yeah, gravity's working.
Those old cable cars on the... You should write a letter.
Wow! Something smells good. Those, uh... goodies in there?
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
No, you shouldn't. Good call.
What are you doing in the big, bad forest?
You taking the goodies to someone in particular?
- Um... my granny. - Granny?
Granny Puckett? The goody lady?
My goodness, she makes some good... goodies.
She's got a thing, it's like a... It's like a... cookies.
Shortbread, chocolate icing between, very...
It's good. Ah, it's very good.
You make deliveries to your granny often?
I don't think I should tell you that.
Oh, you don't have anything else in that?
You ask a lot of questions, mister.
Well, I'm a curious guy. Let me have a look.
I'd rather you didn't.
- [Growls] - [Screams]
[Wolf] Red! Red Riding Hood!
[Red whimpering]
Hand over the basket.
Aaah!
[Gasping]
[Birds humming]
[Wolf] Red!
- [Screams] - [Splashes]
[Wolf] You can't hold onto those recipes forever!
I'll get you, and your little Granny too!
[Chief] Well, that settles it.
- We got our Bandit. - Could be.
I'd like to count my chickens after they hatch.
[Snorts] Chickens?
You've gotta admit, a wolf stopping kids in the middle of the forest...
- That's pretty creepy. - Right. Yes, yes.
But we don't arrest people for being creepy.
Yeah, Bruce. You know that guy we got in the tank?
- The creepy one? - Yeah. Better let him go.
[Nicky] So you went on to Granny's?
I found an old trail up the north side of the mountain.
[Bird shrieking]
[Singing in distance]
Hello!
[Singing in distance]
[Singing]
Hello.
[Yodel-style singing]
I'm looking for Granny Puckett's house.
@ Granny Puckett
- Could you stop singing for one moment? - @ No, I can't, I wish I could
@ But a mountain witch done put a spell on me 37 years ago
@ And now I gotta sing everything I say
- Everything? - That's right.
You just talked! Just now!
Did I?
@ Did I?
@ Did I, did I, did I doo-dah, doo-dah did-i-doo
- Granny? - What's that? Who's there?
It's Red. I'm on my way to come see...
Oh, my dearie, I'm not prepared.
I need to put down fresh doilies! Aah!
- Granny! Granny, what's wrong? - Gotta go, munchkin.
Bonsai!
Oh, no.
Mr. Goat, my granny's in trouble.
I've gotta find a way around the mountain, fast.
@ Well, you came to the right goat
Oh, good. More singing.
@ Thirty-seven years ago a witch done put a spell on me
Yeah. I know.
@ A spell where when I'm talking I'm singing it with glee
@ But when you're always singing you've got to live alone
@ That's why I made this mountain shack my home
That's great...
@ When you're on the mountain there's lots to be a-feared
@ That's why this here old mountain goat's prepared
@ Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
These tunnels, I need one that leads to Puckett Grove.
[Yodel-style singing]
Ohh.
@ But I got horns that open bottles and I got horns that hold my keys
@ I got horns that when you turn 'em right
@ They help me watch TV
@ I got horns that open pickle jars and horns that come with hair
@ I got horns that hang my other horns
@ I always come prepared
- Can you help me find? - @ To be prepared, to be prepared
@ This lesson must be shared This lesson must be shared
@ To be prepared
@ To be prepared, to be prepared
@ And unless you've got a spare
@ You've got one life so handle it with care
- Aaah! - [Japeth] Yipee!
Keep your hands and feet inside of the vehicle at all times!
[Yodel-style singing]
[Screaming]
[Red laughing]
Whoo-wee!
[Rumbling]
@ An avalanche is coming and I do not feel prepared
@ It's rumbling like a mountain lion I must say that I'm scared
@ And if not for the witch's spell you'd hear just how I scream
@ But since I'm only singing I'll just yodel till we're creamed
[yodeling]
Aaah! Aaah!
Aaah!
[Screaming]
[Granny] Red!
Granny?
Use the hood, Red!
Use the hood!
[Helicopter blades whir]
What?
[Yodeling]
@ I was prepared!
Granny! It's me, Red. Is everything OK?
Oh, yeah, sure thing.
So this wolf, he was dressed as your grandmother?
- Yes. - I'm your grandma.
- And you bought that? - No, not really.
Whoa. What big hands you have.
And what big ears you have.
What bad breath you have! What big eyes you have.
Are we just gonna sit around here and talk about how big I'm getting?
Then the fellow with the ax burst in?
- Aaah! - Whoa! Whoa!
No, no, not yet.
First I was attacked by that crazy wolf!
Hai-ya! You crazy wolf!
[Red] My granny jumped out of a closet.
- Aaah! - But she was tied up...
And then the axman cometh?
You got it.
Only he was screaming.
Arghh?
Like a maniac.
- [Yelling] - [Screaming]
- Wow. - Hmm.
- So that was it? - That wolf was gonna eat us all.
The guy's pawprints are all over the room. Book him!
Hold the phone, fuzzy-wuzzy. Let's hear it from the wolf's mouth.
- Don't I get a drink? - No!
So, Mr. Wolf, may I call you "Wolf"?
You can call me Sheila. I like long walks and fresh flowers.
Quit playing around, Wolf!
You're looking at three-to-five in an old shoe with no windows!
So start singing!
- Your face looks familiar. - I get around the forest.
What do you for a living, Mr. Wolf?
I'm a shepherd. Hey!
You might as well confess. I told them everything!
Could you keep her away from me, please?
I remember you.
Three years ago on the Stiltskin case.
You were snooping around for a lead on his real name.
I was close too.
I was gonna go with "Greg." Greg Stiltskin.
Wait a minute, Flippers! You saying this guy's a cop?
Worse. He's a reporter.
- A what? - And I've got the real story.
[Bicycle bell rings]
[Wolf] I'm an investigative journalist.
You've probably read my column Facts and Fairy Tales.
[Typewriter typing, dings]
I spent the last six months undercover
investigating the so-called "Goody Bandit."
As more recipes go missing, the trail has gotten hotter.
- [All] Huh? - [Laughing]
And I'm talking hot coffee, hot coffee,
all over my neck. Very, very painful.
People think a health board examiner doesn't lead a dangerous life,
but I will tell you, my furry friend, food is dangerous.
That's why Kenny told me to come and take a look.
- Who? - Your boss, Kenny.
- You mean Earl? - That's what Earl said.
He said, uh, "Kenny, come down here," and so, here I am.
I'm surprised your dessert counter hasn't been hit,
with all the thievery going around.
- What did you say your name was? - Shaw. Rick Shaw. I'm in from Japan.
Well, Kenny, I'm gonna give you a clean bill of health.
But I'm gonna need the names of all your suppliers.
- You'll have to talk to Earl. - [Pager beeping]
Well, that's Earl right now. Probably called the FDA.
You keep that thing groomed. And watch out for hot coffee. Painful.
No desserts. Waste of time.
[Bike bell rings]
[Wolf] The little delivery girl in the red hood.
Always on the go.
More goodies pass through her hands than anyone's in the whole forest.
She seemed happy...
...a little too happy, perhaps.
Oh! Creepy.
I was starting to have my suspicions.
Question: Who does she move the goodies for?
Where do they come from? Where are they going?
And why the hood?
Aaah!
- Twitchy, you scared me. - Hey, boss, I beeped you. Get my beep?
- Calm down. - I got up early. Got the gear.
I was watching the girl like you told me to.
- Yeah. Did you see where she went? - Past porcupines and the bird's tree,
guy with the beard, now she's up the creek! She sings everywhere!
I'm way ahead of you. We gotta find out who she's working for.
- You got the camera? - The 220x and photograb with autofocus!
- Color or black and white? - Doesn't matter.
- I brought a flash! - Put that away!
- It's covert. No flash. - Undercover, got it.
Nobody sees, nobody knows. Click-click. Hee-hee.
You ever thought about decaffeinated coffee?
I don't drink coffee!
Hmm...
Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon.
[Wolf] I decided to get the word on the street from one of my top informants.
- How's it going, Woolworth? - Man, what are you doing here?
The shepherd comes by and sees me talking to you, I'm gonna get the crook.
Yeah? There's a bigger crook on the loose that I'm concerned about.
- What ya hear about the Goody Bandit? - What do I know?
- Hiya, Twitchy. - [Bleating]
- The little girl in the red hood. - Don't know, never heard of her.
Little Red? Processing...
Yeah, yeah, it's coming back to me now. Sweet gal. Not like that Bo Peep.
Brat put in an invisible fence. I tasted my own fillings for a week!
Focus! The girl in the hood.
You get around the mountain. Who does she work for?
How should I know? I ain't that curious.
Family business. Ain't you ever heard of Granny Puckett?
- Puckett? - Her grandma.
The Granny Puckett? You pulling the wool over my eyes?
Ha-ha. Hilarious. Come up with that yourself? That's funny.
- You're looking pretty tasty. - Why you gotta be like that?
All I know is that the old lady lives up high in the hills.
- Not a lot of visitors. - Except the little girl.
She's been known to take the cable car up the mountain.
Cable car?
Those sheep made me hungry. After this, we're grabbing a bite.
Sounds good. Sounds good.
[Over receiver] Baa.
[Frog croaking]
[Spanish music]
[Male 1] I don't know what to do. Should I call her?
- Am I supposed to play it cool? - [Male 2] Keeping her options open.
Seeing other people. You should do the same.
[Male 1] Shh. Up there.
Do you mind?
Ooh. Sorry.
[Static, radio signals]
[Boingo] Hey, you deliver up this far?
[Static]
[Red] The Muffin Man... Granny's recipes...
...an evil plan.
...shut down everyone in the forest...
I knew it.
She's working for the old lady. Twitchy.
[Chattering]
[Red] Aaah!
- [Camera shutter clicking] - [Red grunting]
[Red] Aaah!
Ooh! Uhh!
Uhh! Ooh! Ugh!
Ouch!
[Sputtering]
[Gasps]
- [Growling] - Ohh!
[Growling]
Ahh!
Ohh!
- [Gasps] - 'Afternoon.
Hello.
So you're the little girl in the red hood.
That's quite a bit of falling you did just now.
[Coughing]
[Wolf] Gravity's working.
What are you doing in the big, bad forest?
You taking goodies to someone in particular?
[Red] Um... Granny.
[Wolf] You don't have anything else in that basket?
- You ask a lot of questions, mister. - Well, I'm a curious guy.
- Let me have a look. - [Red] I'd rather you didn't.
- [Yelling] - [Screaming]
I mean, "please." Come back here!
- What are you doing? - Sorry, I was winding.
Come on! We're gonna lose her! Red! Red Riding Hood!
We'll never catch her.
Taxi!
[Door slams]
[Music plays on radio]
Whoa! That was her. We passed her. Right here's fine.
[Tires screech]
Suspect is approaching on foot, stolen recipes in basket.
I'm about to catch her red-handed.
- [Gasps] - Hand over the basket!
- Aaah! - Hyahh!
So you really took a beating...
...from a little girl? - Hey!
- Hai-yah! - Ooh!
Get back here, you little brat!
[Panting]
@ One, two, buckle to you Ready or not, here I come
@ Don't you run away
@ A-B-C, I can read And the sign up ahead said
@ Son, you're the 1-2-3-4 Knock on the door
@ Open up, gotta run away @@
OK. Not cool. Ahhh!
You can't hold onto those recipes forever!
I'll get you, and your little Granny too!
Well, that's fishy.
What? They're evil. I'll prove it!
[Panting]
[Coughing]
- So can we eat? - Sure. You hungry for failure?
Maybe a side of unemployment? 'Cause that's what's for lunch.
- What do we do? - We go right to the source.
We gotta get to Granny's before the kid.
- [Boingo] Is it a surprise? - Excuse me?
You're going over to Granny's house to surprise Red. Is it her birthday,
or what is it? Is there a shindig? 'Cause I'm great at parties.
- Watch me pull myself out of a hat! - Yeah.
Big surprise party. You know how to get there?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. In fact, I know a shortcut.
You hear that? He knows a shortcut.
Over the woods and through the river...
No, you don't want to go through the river, you'll get all wet.
You see, Twitchy, you get lemons, you make lemonade.
And then that lemonade goes bitter and ferments and turns to pig swill.
Never trust a bunny with directions, Twitchy.
Sure thing, boss. Never trust a bunny!
The bright side is, at least I finally dried off.
Ohh!
Why couldn't I write movie reviews?
We are in a pickle, and I blame myself.
That bunny was worthless, not to mention he wrote directions on an Easter egg,
- which is hard to read. - We're gonna die here!
Hey, now, that's what they said at The Alamo.
[Growling]
Wha... what was that? Who's that?
Aaah!
[Both screaming]
Uhh!
Hey, look where we are. More cave.
- Hey, whazzi-lookie! - With God as my witness,
you will learn to speak. Look! A way out.
But I was just... Ahh!
Follow me.
Hmm...
- Huh? - Come on.
@ Train
@ Train
@ Living like a bandit @
Now, this is a shortcut.
Whazzat? Sounds like an avalanche!
Well, Twitchy, that's natural.
It's just Old Man Mountain showing us who's boss.
Hey, lookie! A box of candles! A big box!
Box of candles? Light 'em up!
Wow, that's nice and bright. What kind of candles are those?
- Deen-a-meet-tay. Must be Italian. - Ah! Lose the candle!
- But I... - Ahhh!
Got it.
Ahhh!
[Screaming]
[Whistling in distance]
[Red] Aaahhh!
- Did you hear something? - Hm?
Hm. Come on, let's get to Granny's.
Hello! Paper boy.
Publisher's, uh...
Candygram.
What do we do, boss?
Ohh!
[Wolf] Lucky for me, Granny keeps her merchandise around the cottage.
Disguise was the only way to catch this girl
in the act of smuggling.
[High-pitched voice] Sweetie-pie! Sugar plum!
[Clears throat]
Hug your granny, little pudding pop.
Aww!
Boy, that's hot. OK, change of plans.
- You can be Granny. - [Knocking]
She's coming!
- Wa-dee-dee! - Ohh!
[Red] Granny! It's me, Red.
- Is everything OK? - Yeah, sure thing. Come on in.
[Chief] Pretty thin, Wolf.
You said the old lady was already tied up.
- How did that happen? - I don't know,
maybe to make herself look innocent.
I just write the news, chief, I don't make it.
For a reporter, you have a strange way of doing your job.
What can I say? I was raised by wolves.
- Got a way to back this up? - I got these pictures developed.
That so? Let's have a look.
These are good.
- Here's a nice one of you, Wolf. - Ugh!
I wanna do a gallery show. A coffee table book.
I don't drink coffee. A Chai tea latte book.
Photos don't lie, chief.
- Good work, Twitchy. - Arghh.
Now, I want to know more about this fellow with the ax.
How does he fit into all of this?
Maybe you should "ax" him yourself. [laughing]
You see? "Ax" him? He was saying...
I'll bring him in.
Ohh!
[German accent] Hmm. Hello.
My, my. You're a big fellow, aren't you?
- Shop at the Big and Tall store? - This is a big and tall mistake.
I would not hurt a butterfly.
Then what's this? A letter opener?
That's a funny accent you got there, choppy.
I can do the cowboy accent. Howdy, partner!
Indeed you can.
Say, before you ride off into the sunset, hopalong,
you think you could rustle up information?
I will do my best.
How about explaining what you were doing in the forest?
Oh! I am working to make good my call-back!
Your what-what?
Paul's Bunion Cream has a soothing formula
to make the bunions head for the hills!
- This guy's a loon. - Watch it, chief. My mama's half-loon.
Your call-back. You mean, like, for an audition?
Yes! For the bunion cream.
I must find my wood-cutting self to book the spot.
- The what? - The commercial.
- He's an actor. - Oh, boy.
Arghh!
Paul's Bunion Cream has the soothing formula...
[male] No, hold it! Hold it!
- Stop. "Arghh"? - Uh-huh.
What are you, some kind of German pirate or something?
I just got the script, like, five minutes ago.
- You're not getting it. - I'm trying.
- My name Kirk. - Kirk. OK, Kirk.
What makes you feel proud and strong and mighty?
What puts a fire in your belly, Steven?
- Oh! My dream! - Yes, yes! Your dream!
To travel the world
with the greatest singing group of all time...
...the Happy Yodelers!
@ To yodel for the people
@ To hear the applause
@ My dream @
- [crashing] - Sorry.
Listen. We'll look at your tape and we'll give you a call, OK?
Thanks for coming in. Have a nice life. Next!
[Bell rings]
[Kirk] That was my first audition in months.
- [Red singing] - Then it was back to my day job.
I drive a schnitzel truck.
It's not such a bad job.
After all, I bring much joy to the children!
@ Schnitzel!
Mommy, Mommy! I want a schnitzel stick!
Ooh, the schnitzel man!
[Yodeling]
[Woman] @ Schnitzel, the favorite treat For little girls and boys to eat
@ Schnitzel man can serve them quick
@ It's a schnitzel on a stick
@ No more spoons Use your hands
[woman] @ Says the friendly schnitzel man
@ Make sure you keep an extra one
@ For later in your lederhosen
- [yodeling] - [Kids cheering]
- [Kirk] Schnitzel! - Ow!
- [Woman] @ Schnitz... - [record scratches]
What the schnitzel?
My schnitzel truck, it's been piddly... piddle-llaged...
They stole everything!
[All groaning]
[Boingo] Oh, that's too bad.
It's not easy being in the goody business these days, huh?
I'm getting schnitzeled left and right today.
I cannot even sell the bunion cream.
- Now I'm gonna lose my job! - Chin up, mister.
Maybe someday somebody will open up a great big goody shop
and we can all work for that little guy.
- Oh, yeah... What? - [Phone ringing]
Uhh...
- Hello? - Kirk! Yeah, baby, listen.
We got the client here, we looked at your tape,
and we think we might have a real "Hercules goes bananas" angle on this.
- So we want you to come back in. - Come back in?
It's a call-back.
[Kirk] I had always heard about call-backs,
but I had never gotten one!
A call-back?
Ahh! What do I do?
You come back tomorrow, do the same you did today,
only this time you do it good. Can you handle that?
- I will. I can do it! - OK.
Now, I want you to go out into the wild
and I want you to find that tree-chopping side of yourself.
You find your inner woodsman, Curtis.
Don't act like a woodsman, be a woodsman. Got it?
Yes, I can!
Find an ax, start swinging, OK?
I've gotta be in a circle wipe across town, but I'll see you at 10:00.
I have to go and find the little woodsman...
...in me!
OK. Well, tell him I said hello.
[Grunting]
[Growling]
Ay! Ay-ay-ay-ay!
Ooh!
Ha-ha!
Goodbye!
Hup, hup!
- [Car alarm sounding] - [Chattering]
- [Birds chirping] - Sorry, little birds!
Run!
[Kirk] I had done it!
I had found the little woodsman inside of me!
[Gasps]
Yes.
Paul's... Bunion...
...Cream...
...has the soothing formula...
...to make your bunions...
...head for the hills! [laughs]
Right!
...bunion...
...cream...
...has the soothing...
...formula...
[screaming in distance]
Hello?
[Cracking]
Ohh...
Oh, schnitzel!
Aah! Aah!
Ohh! Ohh!
Aahhh!
I'm taking Granny down, and you're next!
Aahhh!
[All screaming]
[Silence]
So you didn't jump through the window, you were pushed?
- Yes. - By a tree.
Yes.
Because you were pretending to be a woodsman.
- That's right! - To sell foot cream.
I got the call-back!
And good for you.
Well, I think it's safe to say that our thespian friend here
knows the least about anything of anyone in this room.
Exactly! What does that mean?
That it all points to Granny.
[Nicky] What about it, Granny?
Maybe you're not the sweet goody-maker everyone thinks you are.
Are you stealing recipes to protect your sugar-coated kingdom?
Oh, no, Mr. Flippers.
The only crime I've ever committed
is making my goodies unlawfully delicious!
My granny doesn't keep secrets.
And even if she did, she'd tell me about it.
We tell each other everything. Right, Granny?
Sure, dear. Mostly.
- Mostly? - What are you hiding, old girl?
My family worries too much. I didn't want them to find out.
- Find out what? - Yeah. What?
- [Door opens] - [Bill] Hey, chief!
Check this out!
[All gasp]
When did they make that a sport?
I noticed you have three G's tattooed on the back of your neck.
That's appropriate, since there are three strikes against you.
It's true.
I'm not like other grannies.
I never did like the quilting bees and the bingo parlors.
I'd rather live life to the extreme.

Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Woo-hoo!
[Granny] That must have been right about when Red called me the second time.
I always forward my phone when I leave the house.
- [Red] Granny? - What's that? Who's there?
- Take that, from Mr. Big Muscleman! - Want some of this?
Ha-ha!

[Red] Granny! It's me, Red. Is everything OK?
[Wolf as Granny] Yeah, sure thing. Come on in.
[Granny] Eventually I was able to use the squirrel to break down the door.
Ow! That hurts!
[Wolf] I'm taking Granny down, and you're next!
[Granny] I could've handled that wolf myself.
But then the craziest thing happened.
[Glass breaks, all screaming]

Honey, don't look at your granny like that.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Triple G.

[Red] How do you remember all these recipes?
[Granny] They're all right here in this book.
Every recipe in here comes from the Puckett family,
generation after generation. See?
Now, there's Sylvia Puckett at the North Pole.
She found the best hot chocolate in the world there.
And there's Emma Puckett.
She flew cheesecakes across the Atlantic.
For as long as critters have had a sweet tooth,
Pucketts have been making and collecting recipes
all over the world,
refining them, giving them that special Puckett touch.
So you see, Red, when you put that hood on,
you carry on a grand tradition.
It's a big job, making sure the world stays sweet.
[Red chuckles]
Huh? What's this?
Oh, it says, "World's Greatest Grandma."
Grandma, I can read.
It says, "Battle of the Iron Cage Gladiators."

Maybe you naughty neighbors butted heads so we could get to the real truth.
- The Goody Bandit. - That's right.
The Bandit's still at large.
There's been a lot of finger-pointing tonight,
but now all fingers point to the Bandit.
- Not my finger! - Oh, no,
you were just out damaging forest property,
cutting down the redwoods we all call home.
Big guy like you, you could probably take whatever you want
from little goody-loving creatures.
But someone robbed me! Have we lost track of that?
That's right, someone did.
Maybe a snack food competitor.
Right, Granny?
Now, hold on a pea-picking minute!
I may lead a double life full of secrets and deception,
- but that's no reason to be suspicious. - Huh?
A woman like you could have a lot to gain stealing all those recipes.
And that's how she makes her goodies so good! Huh?
Or she could just be another victim...
- What? ...of a hungry wolf!
The wolf did it. Talk about profiling.
Why should we trust someone who wears disguises for a living?
- Maybe he's not a wolf at all! - You got me. I'm a poodle.
- Just haven't been to the barbershop. - Is this all just a big joke to you?
- I just followed the girl here. - You leave my granddaughter alone!
Yes, now we get to Little Red,
the girl with the basket on the run.
- Where is she, anyway? - I was just...
[groans] The recipes are gone!
- Are you saying Red is the Bandit? - Not my Red!
Calm down there, Triple G.
The only thing your granddaughter is guilty of
is flying hummingbirds without a license.
It would seem there is another player in this game,
someone who's hippity-hopped his way through all of your stories.
[Thunder crashes]
Yes, there's someone else.
The only one who was with Red when she fell...
- Ohh! - No!
...who knew a shortcut to Granny's...
Oh, yeah. In fact, I know a shortcut.
...who fraternizes with evil ski teams...
- What's your name? - Put, "To my biggest and cutest fan."
...and someone who was there
when the schnitzel truck was schnitzeled.
What the schnitzel?
Not the bunny!
- I knew it. Never trust a bunny. - Never trust a bunny!
- Uh, chief. - Yeah?
No one's seen the bunny or the girl, and that cable car left the station.
I think we need an APB out on something small and fuzzy.
I think you're right.
Get your boys to Red's place. We need to head off that cable car.
And bring in a police sketch artist. No, make it a cartoonist.
We gotta hurry to beat it down. Bill, get everyone in the cars.
Tommy, you can bring that evidence with you. Let's go!
- You heard the chief, let's move it! - [Chief] Not in the same car!
[Bill] Keep it moving. There's nothing to see.
- [Officer 1] Who's got my keys? - [Officer 2] Shotgun.
[Sirens blare]
- Did you get any shots of the bunny? - The bunny? Why?
I told you to take pictures of everything!
Ohh! We gotta get this to print before it's all over the forest!
Something don't sit right in my bones about this.
[Yodeling in distance]
- [Gasps] What's that? - Maybe it's your bones.
[Sniffs] I smell schnitzel.
[Yodeling music plays]
What have they done to my schnitzel truck?
[Wolf] Why are they going up?
There's on old cable car station at the top of the mountain.
We've got to follow them, boys. Red's up there. I know it!
Get down the mountain. You gotta stop those cops.
Run 'em off the road, dangle a donut, I don't care.
- Tell 'em they're going the wrong way. - Eezie-peezie! Leave it to me!
You'll never catch 'em in time.
Is that coffee?
I can't believe I'm saying this, but... drink up.
We may want...
...to stand back.
[Sniffs, smacks lips]
[Bells ring, horns toot]
Yee-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Caffeine! Yeah, baby!
- Whoa! - Go get 'em, boy.
[Laughing]
[Sonic boom]
What...
...have I done? - Now the rest is up to us.
Can I have coffee?
[Thunder crashes]
[Zapping, buzzing]
I don't like it. The cops are all over the place.
Forget about the cops!
We've got everything we need right here.
What about the old lady? If she's alive, she'll be back.
You just don't get it, do you, Dolph? I'm done!
I'm done dancing for the man!
The Muffin Man and Granny!
They can both take a hike!
I'm never gonna answer to anyone ever again!
A-ha-ha!
[Cackling]
Ah, I just love my job!
You see how it works, Dolph?
You prioritize, you set your goals, you write a mission statement.
You ask yourself, "Where do I see me in five years?"
[Red] How about behind bars?
Red! Oh, hi, Red! What are you?
- You've spoiled the surprise. - You're the Bandit.
Surprise!
I'm walkin' out of here with those recipes.
- Really? - Yeah.
You're a bad bunny.
Oh, somebody's finally catching up!
Did you think I followed you around on your deliveries because I liked you?
Oh, you best be fearing the ear, baby.
Ahh!
Hai-yahh!
Is that all you got?
- Ohh! - Ha! You hit like a girl!
Come on.
And ka-blam!
[Sniffling]
Why don't you go home and cry to your granny?
Dolph, tie up the brat. Lesa, hold the book.
Vincent, get the truck. And Keith...
Darn it, change your name. Please.
That's not scary, and I'm embarrassed to say it.
- Boris. Try that. - Hmm.
Keith. You know?
Oh, watch out for Keith.
- You're crazy! - Maybe so.
But I'm top of the woods now, baby!
@ When you're
@ Hopping on down the bunny trail
@ The critters all seem to look down
@ You're fuzzy and small Your ears are too tall
@ And goodies make the woods go round
@ Now, I'm not a pig But you gotta think big
@ When you're competing with the girl in the hood
@ So you won't be a fan of my evil plan
@ But I'm gonna be top of the woods
@ Now the kids will be packed with my Boingo snacks
@ Construction begins in a day
@ And all of the bears will be ruled by the hare
@ As I maniacally plot from my evil lair
[cackles]
[Whistling tune]
We've really grown in the past year. Nabbing all the recipes was phase one.
Now phase two is adding my own special ingredient
to every goody.
A little something I like to call "Boingonium."
It makes my snacks a little more... habit-forming.
Happy customer!
Phase three gets a little messy.
I'm gonna need a lot of real estate down the mountain,
so I've gotta blow the competition away.
Oh, and that's not a metaphor.
We've literally got to blow them away. OK?
Yeah, I got it.
And now that I have your granny's secrets,
I'm afraid you'll be taking the dyno-mite express home.
- [Muffled screaming] - [Boingo laughing]
@ You won't be disrespecting this bunny no more
@ 'Cause I'm gonna be top of the woods Oh, yeah
@ I said I'm gonna be top of the woods
@ Let's bring it on home!
@ I said, I'm gonna be
@ Top of the woods
@ You've been hoodwinked, baby!
@ Oh, yeah @
Sweet tea and cookies! We got to do something!
I know.
The song was catchy, but the choreography was terrible.
OK, listen.
I have an idea, but we need to get past that ski team.
The toughest one is the big fella, really mean-looking,
with a fat head and a thick skull. Looks like a shaved ape.
- [Clears throat] - I mean, he is u-u-u-ugly!
Like a big, swollen, overgrown...
He's standing right behind me, isn't he?
- Mm-hm. - Ahh!
[All shouting, grunting]
Ah.
[Chomping]
[Sirens blare]
Ohh! Ohh!
Whoa!
Whew!
- Who taught you how to drive? - Almost hit a squirrel. That was close.
- Whee-yahh! - [All screaming]
- [Metal crunching] - [Glass breaking]
[Sputtering]
What's the big idea?
I could've made road pizza out of you, kid!
[Babbling]
- What's he saying? - What is it, boy?
- [Babbling] - Truck. Trouble at the mill!
Is the barn on fire?
The barn's on fire! The well! Timmy's stuck in the well!
Hold on. He seems to be speaking words of some kind.
Pffsst!
You're a delivery girl. Then could you do me a favor?
Could you take this down the mountain?
'Cause it absolutely, positively has to be there tonight!
I'm sorry. What? I can't quite... with the...
You got something right there across your mouth! [laughs]
[Muffled shouting]
You're an actor, right? So this is your big part.
This is the role of a lifetime. Make them believe in you.
Don't act like an evil henchman, be an evil henchman. Got it?
- Know what you're gonna say, right? - Right!
- [Red struggling] - [Chuckling]
- Mr. Rabbit? - Dolph! Where have you been?
You nim-witted Eurotrash with the... What is that, a ski mask?
I like that. See, that's scary. That's good.
- Boss... - What? Say it! Spit it out!
- What's going on? - Boss...
Paul's Bunion cream has the soothing formula...
Hi there. What he means to say is that I'm the building inspector.
- Yes. - I just need to tap the pipes
to see if your wiring's up to par.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it. You're not... No. You can't touch anything in here.
Let's walk.
Let me level with you. You're an evil genius, right?
Well, I don't know if I'd say genius, you know.
I was asked to join Mensa.
You got an evil lair in a cave, that's standard,
but see, most masters of evil that we deal with
are up to evil genius code.
Are you familiar with the code?
You know, I'm more of a do-it-yourself kind of guy. Yeah.
I understand. Thinking about putting in a laser?
I don't know. I don't... Do you think I should?
Well, it's standard equipment for a cave lair.
I'm not saying you're gonna zap someone today,
but you gotta think about the future. They gotta be calibrated.
- You gonna do that yourself? - Well, I... I...
We should take a look at that power grid.
OK. Yeah, sure, sure.
Wait a minute.
[Sniffs]
I smell hairspray.
[Gasps] A-haaa!
Come here, you little bunny!
- [Granny laughs] - Huh?
Ooh!
Whoo!
Ha-ha!
Gotcha!
Get over here!
- Aahhh! - [Bike bell rings]
Hey, Puckett!
Little Red's gonna take a ride!
And there ain't...
...no...
...brakes!
[Cackling]
Red!
Aah!
Whoo!
She doesn't trust you anymore, Granny!
Out of my way, bunny!
Whoo! Ha-ha!
Ahh!
Uhh!
- [Groans] - [Panting]
[Whooping]
Dolph!
Whahh!
Wow, that's a... that's a long way.
- We could take the truck. - Let's take the truck.
Yeah, cool.
They go up, you go down. Gotta help! APB! Get the bunny!
- This squirrel ate the wrong nuts. - English! What's wrong with you?
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
[Babbling]
[Rewinding]
[Babbling]
Ah... OK.
The criminal cannot be found at the bottom of the mountain.
He resides at the top in a cave fortress
where my companions are trying to detain him.
[Chuckles] Aww.
- That's more like it. - How do we know he's on the level?
He threw himself in front of a car. That's commitment.
No, that's crazy. We can't get up there in time anyway.
Hey, chief! It looks like they're coming to us!
Ahh!
Ohh! Ohh!
[Granny] A-ha!
- Granny! - I'm coming, honey!
Grab the hood!
[Grunting]
[Gasps]
Aahhh!
[Screams]
[Laughing] Hold tight!
- Whoo-hoo! - [Laughs]
[Boingo] End of the line, ladies! [Cackling]
- Granny! - You know what to do.
Whoo!
Oh, wonderful.
No!
Watch your head.
- Oh! - Ow!
[Dolph] That hurts.
Get 'em outta here, boys.
[Engine starts]
- No, no, no, no. Not prison. - Say Parcheesi!
Not prison! Not for a cute little bunny rabbit!
Not prison! Not for a cute little bunny rabbit!
- [Applause] - Granny, Little Bit, we got 'em!
- Not bad for a little cookie maker. - Thanks.
I guess I must have had my eyes shut pretty tight
not to see how fast you were growing up.
You were really something up there.
I take after my granny.
[Vehicle approaches]
[Kirk] Hello, everybody! Here, we have the book!
[Crash]
[Car alarm blaring]
- What happened here tonight? - My granny swooped in and saved me.
- And the whole forest! - It was my Red who saved the day.
Well, it was a group effort, spearheaded by myself, of course.
You'll read the story in tomorrow's column, but I will take a few questions.
Mr. Kirkendal will be appearing in our ad campaign...
- I got a call-back! - No, don't talk.
If a tree falls in the forest, you'll get three stories,
- yours, mine and the tree's. - [All laughing]
Well, a bunny gone bad is going away,
and you'll wake up tomorrow with piping hot tea cakes,
same as always.
[Granny] Ooh!
Those are piping hot.
So how about that new delivery system?
Well, it beats riding a bike, that's for sure.
@ I got horns that hold the muffins
@ And I got horns that hold the pies
Hey, did you hear about Kirk? He finally made it.
[Yodeling]
- Wanna see the show with us? - I'm allergic to yodeling.
- Now, Wolfie... - I'm front page material now,
I'm about to crack a story about the three pigs
running a home improvement scam. Houses falling.
I got the wide-angle lenses for those piggies.
You sure this is the right place?
- Ah. - Mr. Flippers.
I see you all got my message.
- Glad you could make it. - What's going on?
Well, I was wondering if you would like to come and work for me.
I could use some fresh talent like you.
What kind of work are we talking about?
You'd be undercover, on impossible missions...
...to faraway places.
There's a lot of stories out there that need a happy ending.
I'm part of a secret organization that makes sure that happens.
"Happily Ever After Agency"?
The woods don't go around by themselves.
We fight the bad guys, swing through the windows
secret-agent-style, right?
So, what do you think?
Bring it, honey.
I always did like happy endings.
[@ Todd Edwards: Critters Have Feelings]
Horton
On the fifteenth of May
in the jungle of Nool
in the heat of the day
in the cool of the pool
He was splashing enjoying the jungle's great joys.
And Horton,the elephant heard a small noise.
- Horton!  - Horton!
Good morning, class. Are you ready?
Yeah!
Jump on board!
Look out, below!
Tommy's on board.
Katie, you there?
OK.
There it is.
This is one of the jungle's most amazing creatures.
The leaf bug.
In order to protect itself from predators
It disguises itself as a leaf
This one's got quite a deep grip.
Come on, little buddy! Don't be shy!
I guess I was mistaken, Kids.
There are obviously no leaf bugs in this area.
Even a per... Oh! They're on me.
Look at, there are bugs
I think I swallowed it.
Shoot up! Uhek it's not coming.
Pull it out.
Uh, OK.
Then, humphing her nose was sour Kangaroo.
A type who's convince she knows better than you
She made every law and then forced every rule
as self conclaimed head of the jungle of the Nool.
Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?
How many times have I told you?
The jungle is no place to act like a wild animal.
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric?
And that children are learning so much from him.
Learning to be a bunch of a hell brain halfwits.
And that's why my Rudy is pouch schooled.
So, while Kangaroos still there sneering a sneer
Horton,how it's the best time of my life.
What are you gonna show us then?
Once again the speck floated right by Horton's ear.
And he heard it again.
Just a very faint yelp, as if some tiny person were calling for help.
And you know what he thought?
What he thought there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust.
Or even a famly. It just might be so.
A family with children just starting to grow.
I wanna live!
I got to go. Katie, you're in charge.
Wait!
Come back!
One more, one more, one more, one more.
- Ah here someone coming.  - Get here those.
- Wait!  - Sound the alarm!
Excuse me! On my stamp feet!
Sorry, Wickershams.
I promise I'm gonna clean all this up later!
Bring the arrow!
I love the smell of the banana's in the morning.
Bananing Hoe!
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!
I feel diplomatic process is beginning to break down.
There you are.
I'll catch it. catch it.
Hi, kids.
There
Now you're safe.
I know I heard you say something.
I just know it.
Where are you?
- Horton?  - Uhoo, sorry.
I just...ah.
There was this speck.
And the... they called up for help.
- And I was...  - The speck...
called out for help?
Well not the speck. I mean
That's ridiculous.
Is what you thought I've been?
No,the speck can't call out for help. Come on.
Get real!
No.
There's a tiny person on that speck and he needs my help.
Absurd.
There aren't people that small.
There aren't people that small.
Maybe...
We're big.
- Horton!  - No! Really, think about it.
What if there is someone
way out there,
looking down on our world right now.
And to them, we are the speck.
And then this someone else come along, he say,
"Oh, there can't be people that small."
And the first guy would say
"Are you calling me a liar?"
And the second guy would say
"If the shoe fits wear it,
and now that fits a blind."
and the first guy pick supper break.
And you might wanna zip up the pouch for this next part.
Alright, fat boy!
- You want some of there...  - Horton?
There is nothing on that speck.
But I heard.
Did you? Really? Oh my!
Then how come I don't hear anything.
Well?
If you can't see, hear, or feel something
it doesn't exist.
And believing in tiny imaginary people is just not something we do.
Or tolerate here in the jungle of Nool.
Really?
Cause I verified I really tried
I can find somebody
- who believe what I'm saying.  - You will do nothing of the sort.
You will not breathe the word of this lie to anyone else.
Expecially the children.
I do not want you poisoning their minds with this nonsense.
Our community has standards, Horton.
If you wanna remain a part of that I recommend you follow them.
Have a nice day.
Alright then!
I'll ah...take that an advisement.
Certainly appreciate your input.
I don't understand.
I know I heard you.
It was just as clean as nose on my face.
That's it.
Maybe you can't hear me!
Of course your ears must be tiny.
I need to speak up!
Hello!
Now some people out there
might think I know who
they find they agreed with that Sour Kangaroo
"There can't really be people as small as a mice"
Well there can. And there are.
Becuase Horton was right.
Hellow!
That single "Hello" traveled all the way down
to the speck,to the flowers, to the fount of the small town.
The town known as Whoville for there live the Whos
Really happy in safe, knowing only good news,
unaware that their world was a speck on a clover,
unaware the sweet life they knew might be old
The Mayor of Whoville a man named McDodd
who's devoted and faired and little bit odd.
The Mayor and his wife they had children to spare.
96 daughters, some here and some there.
96 girls to love, 96 girls to teach.
But the Mayors have only few second for each.
Daddy, I do better than best on my whostory test.
Ah, whostory. I remembered well.
Ah, whostory. I remembered well.
That's one of my girls.
Her is has been using my hairbrush.
Look, over there!
There, all better.
Can I please have whophone, daddy?
Everyone else in my class has one.
Oh, really? Everyone?
- Aw! I will think about it.  - Daddy, look! Daddy look!
Toos!
It's "th" sweetheart. It's "Tooth"
In Whoville tradition unlike yours or mine
Mayor's oldest is the next Mayor of line.
And who was the oldest lead and stand tall?
It was JoJo, his son, the smallest who all.
So, JoJo, what's what's shaking?
What's happening? What's the word?
Now to you or to me, it's finally clear
that JoJo did not want his father's career.
But the Mayor pressed forward completely illuded.
And JoJo just sat there in silence and lude it.
Oh, JoJo!
- Hey! Why this he get more time?  - That's not fair!
Son! Hey!
And why didn't he speak?
Well I think the lad was frightened if he did,
he might let down his dad.
You know what's awesome?
This is awesome!
Just look at the men and the women hanging on these walls.
You, my boy, are part of family legacy that spans centuries
You know what?
Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville.
And, your great grandmother, that's right.
All the way down to your
Great
Great, Great, Great
Not so Great
Great, Great, Great
Grandfather!
Some day I hope to join them.
Be one of the Grates.
I tell you JoJo there is nothing like being Mayor.
I get to sign resolutions, approve ordinances, submit budgets.
And in the edible parade
I'm the one siting on top of the giant people.
Some day
That can be you too, JoJo.
Some day you'll be the one wearing the Mayor crest.
You just...
You just need to...
You know what I mean?
OK. Good chat!
I'm glad that we had this talk
That I'm continuing now by myself. Good.
Oh! There. There are to become fit.
Just you and me，and the speck
Shouldn't a breeze.
We're club. We're group.
We can take a vote on issues.
We can be a secret to society
- to control pirate's power in the world.  - Horton?
And no one else can join
Unless they wear funny hats.
Listen, Horton!
The chair recognizes his brother Morton.
I am really happy you found this speck in all.
But you might wanna think about keeping it to yourself.
Um, what, what?
Are you talking to what clover.
That doesn't look good.
You know what doesn't look good?
You, talking about the speck like the speck isn't even there.
Speck never said nothing bad about you.
But hey!
Good luck with your illusional superiority.
You know, the speck can think anything you want about me. It's a speck.
Wow!
I see what's going on here.
Morton, no matter how tight this speck and I get,
the speck could never replace you.
I'm only sad that I would have to explain that at this point.
Well, that's awesome Horton. That really helps.
Just try to keep this to yourself. I'll see you later.
Try.
Hey, Horton? What's you got in there?
What? Nothing.
We're not doing anything.
Who's we?
- We are totally alone.  -We? What we? Did I say that?
I just... Oh, no. I would never say that
because that would imply that I was with someone and not alone.
OK There is a story you can't talk to anybody
I mean it.
If anybody finds out about this, it could be very very bad.
I'm not sure why.
We won't tell anyone.
And if we do, we'll tell them not to tell anyone.
Perfect!
OK
I'm taking a bath, right.
Cause my skin gets kind of dry. My roof gets ashy...
While Horton came clean about the speck that he found
How he saved it and nearly drowned.
The Mayor set off on his morning commute
and noticed things not quite the same on his route.
But please don't blame Horton for he didn't know
that a strong bump above...
I do it in the water like this...
Was a big bump below.
Hey, Joe! Don't work too hard!
Ah! These luxery condos they have gone themselves.
Hey, you look at that. I guess they do build themselves.
OK, that happened.
Now the Mayor knew it was his job
to convey the unusual things that he noticed that day.
There was one problem.
Though his will was strong
- You are late.  - Thank you，Miss Yelp.
Nothing in Whoville had ever gone wrong.
We have all that we need. We need all that we've got.
We like it in here Whoville. We like it a lot.
We're all very busy with WhoCentennial's coming up. So...
Let's break this meeting to order.
Mr. Mayor I presume you have some good news for us.
Well, it's news. I don't know
if we need to go label it good or bad anything like that.
The thing is I have noticed some odd goings on in Whoville lately
Good on goings on?
Well, you know. Tremors, clouds swirling in the sky.
And it seems to me just be safe, we might wanna consider...
Postponing the WhoCentenia?
Consider what?
Postponing the WhoCentenia?
What?! Speak up, man!
Postponing the Whocentennial, alright?
We're about to celebrate 100 years of Whoville happiness in harmony.
And you want to postpone the celebration?
Well, what if Whoville's not safe.
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville!
Never has and never will!
You bloodly boob! Boob.
Boob.
The Whocentennial will proceed as planned!
The Mayor was really being an idiot.
It will be all smiles from now on.
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.
What? What you mean it don't look like me?
That look just like me.
Ten years ago... Wait a minute, hold on for a second.
Treats me like an idiot?
I'm not an idiot.
Do I look like an idiot?
- You don't want me to answer that.  - I'm not an idiot.
That's nerve call me a boob?
I would never call somebody a boob.
He is a boob.
Look at you, yuck.
Look at your face.
And I bet.
You don't look so good with this staple on your head!
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.  - You're welcome.
Hello?
Who's you that? Got go out. I'll punch you.
Hello?
Hello?
Who's there?
Hmm... This the Mayor.
The Mayor?
The Mayor?
Uh, look at this Mayor!
I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
There's life on this speck.
The speck? What speck?
I don't exactly know how to tell you this. But...
You're living on a speck.
Well, I hate to disagree with you.
Oh, voice from the drain pipe.
But, I live in Whoville.
Well, then the Whoville is a speck.
Right. OK Seriously. Who is this?
Is this Bert from accounting?
No. This is Horton.
I'm an elephant.
OK Horton, fake name.
Where are you?
Well, from where you standing?
I guess I'm...
in the sky.
Compare to you I'm enormous
because I slim down quite a bit. I swim.
Your whole world fits on a flower in my world.
Oh, man, this is even inclusion for you, Bert.
Don't believe me?
Watch what happen when I put you in the shade
- This is absolutly impossi...  - Dark
Light.
Dark.
Light.
Dark, light, dark, light...Dark!
Light!
Don't you see it?
We're in the middle of some kind of amazing cosmic convergence.
Two vastly different worlds.
Miraculously crossing path!
Mine colossal!
Yours mini to cure.
Yet, somehow we've marriage to make contact.
If you think about it, it's pretty amazing.
Is everything OK down there?
Oh. I... I don't know.
You tell me...
You're the one holding the speck.
I'm the one who's holding the speck.
I'm the one who's holding the speck.
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.
Hold, please.
What at all this means?
The Mayor hadn't the clue.
So he went to the office of Dr.Larue.
Brainest brain on the staff at Whouse.
Dr. Larue!
Oh, this is crazy.
Oh, Mr. Mayor.
Ah, how may I be a assitance?
I don't know. Hey.
You know I just wondering
If our world will stay tiny speck
floating to space,
how would we know?
Oh, why would you ask something like that?
Oh, no reason, no reason at all.
I don't even remember. Yes I do.
That you know what,
some guy was talking to me
not an elephant in the sky, a guy on the ground
Ah, there would be several ramifications
Good ramifications?
A tiny speck.
Uhhuh, yeah, tiny speck.
Floating around...
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors.
Dramatic changes in the weather.
And if we didn't eventually achieve some sort of stability
our world would be destroyed
Destroyed!
Destroyed, oh destroyed. No somehow.
Horton?
Ah, no. This is Danny. Horton is busy right now.
You, I'm joking. That's me.
Ah, We're doomed.
Listen! Horton!
Turns out I need your help a little bit.
Apparently if that speck keeps moving around,
our whole world could be obliterated.
Ahuh So,
I need you to find us Who's safer more stable home and fast
No problem, Mr. Mayor.
Let's see...
That's a nice view.
Hello, is everything OK?
What's going on up there?
This entire jungle is a house of death!
Oh, wait.
There's good spot.
And it's then Horton saw at the top of mountain Nool
a small cave that was peaceful and quiet and cool
where sun flower grew proud and tall from the ground.
There he knew every Who would be safe,
would be sound.
I found it Mayor.
The perfect place.
Right up there.
- On the top of the mountain Nool.  - Mr. Mayor?
I wish we could...
Ohho, Ah, Shiny. Ahha.
The Whocentennial Committee is waiting for you
to look over the giant meat ball for the edible parade.
Oh, and then you will do at the dinners for your Whowill Canal.
You know, sticking Who in front of everything
Just waste time!
I don't wanna go.
Listen, Horton. I got to go.
Apparently there's problem with the giant people.
You just take care that meatball, Sir.
And leave the freaking out to me.
So, then Horton began his long pairless track
determine to save the small world on the speck.
Horton was faithful and soul working kind.
I got ya.
He was a brave hero.
I'll protect ya.
At least in his mind.
We must become invisible. Travel silently.
For there're forces. They would seek to destroy us.
So, you think you can stick up on me, Huh!
It's clear that you're no match for my ticky kei!
I see you will master the way of snapping branch.
Watch me tumble!
Horton! Let's go!
You are fast, Horton. But the kangaroo has monkeys.
I will make monkeys of these monkeys.
It is their destiny, Huh uh!
HoiYat! My Tumble! My Tumble!
Horton is the Greatest Hero of them all, Ha!
- Horton!  - Morton! Go!
Everyone worships queen Jessica because Jessica is the beautiful.
Rudy?Mom, be careful!
My best friend David grows up on there.
- Rudy, no one lives on this.  - What?
It's not possible.
That Horton is a menace.
Mom, Mom, please. You're so weird.
- Don't do this to me.  - Honey, go to your room.
Horton!
It's good.
What do you think you're doing?
Ha, you got some worlds of trouble.
Have you forgotten what we discussed?
Oh, no. I'm an elephant. And elephants never forget.
Oh, no. I'm an elephant. And elephants never forget.
It's a curse, really.I remember I was on my head.
And you said and I looked up.
And you say what are you doing?
And I said the thing about the speck.
Then you pull my ears.- And you fork in a fore head.
Horton?
What You did?
Give me that clover, Horton.
Now.
No!
No!
No!
Are you sure you wanna fight this fight, Horton?
Becuase I promise you will get very ugly very fast.
And you need to ask yourself.
Do I really worth put myself through this?
For a clover?
Take after me, Horton?
You don't.
So, hand it over.
No! I can't give it to you.
There're people on this speck.
Granted very small people.
But a person's person.
No matter how small.
You just crossed the line, Horton.
And I'm gonna make you pay.
That Horton is a menace.
He has those kids using their imaginations.
It's sick.
Alright.
I got to get this speck up to the top mountain Nool ASAP.
Whatever that means.
Probably "act swiftly awesome, pachyderm."
I mean how hard can it be.
It's just the straight plummet to certain death.
This looks...
kinda precarious.
No?
No need to worry.
Obviously when they build the bridge like this
they take into account the elephants will be corssing here.
Alright. Feel good.
I'll just get... Woo Waaa
You'll alright!
("COURAGE") Um, That's true.
Alright.
Hello and how are we today, Mr. Mayor?
Say Ahh.
Ahh
Wrench, please.
Eh, I think a few of these wood that keep stand need to be replaced.
I just need to think light.
I'm light as a feather.
I'm light as a feather.
Heavy feather.
OK.
This will just pinch little.
I'm lighter than a feather.
What's lighter than a feather?
Haah! Air!
There's nothing lighter.
So, it stands to reason...
get the more air I have
the lighter
I'll be.
Next, please.
Alright. It was absolutely terrifying.
If I just right some on
drawing not to panic.
That could've been a disaster.
I feel really good right now.
It is my new sense of purpose.
Uh alright!
Hey! JoJo I need your help. Can you help me?
OK. Great.
OK. First. I need you go to the girls' room.
Take down the handle and shut it all the collection
Stop looking in arm.
Put away Holly's light bulbs collection and then
you know what，just take care of anything that might break or shatter.
OK, take a good long look.
Got it?
Thanks, JoJo.
Here. I know.
And here.
Uh Yaaa!
Hi! You're home late.
Oh, sorry Honey, I was just...
- having some dental works on my arm.  - So, what was that?
Nedd!
What are you doing?
Wa What do you mean?
Well, I no detective, Nedd. But you are hanging from the chandelier.
I just thought it might look better
somewhere it can't fall on us and crashes our sleep.
What is going on?
Hey, Honey.
Did you ever get the feeling that you're being watched?
Am... Ya, sure.
I suppose.
And then you get feeling that maybe that thing watching you is... Ah...
A giant elephant?
Am...
You know, how you can that weird feeling that your world actually a tiny speck?
And then the elephant that I talked about earlier
he's carrying it around on a flower.
And you realize، then if you tell anybody they think you're crazy.
But you still feel the responsibility to keep everyone safe.
You know that feeling?
Am...
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.
Do you know that feeling?
No!
Wow! I'm meet the time to hit the hey, I guess.
Sweetheart. I know you're under a lot of stress.
And if you're seeing the elephants and flowers, then fine.
Just don't tell anyone else that story.
OK? And remember.
It's not the end of the world.
The end of the world?
Horton, the Mayor. Horton, the Mayor. Come in Mayor, over.
Horton?
I get terrible reception here.
How about this?!!!
If I get up all calls!!! Can hear right, NOW?!!
Yeap! Roger that!
Are we get that safe place yet?
Almost.
I'm pretty sure the worst parts are over.
This is your elephant speaking.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride and we all are happy to the mountain Nool no time.
No, you can't have ice cream. Go back there.
Who's there?
- Is there someone else there?  - Well, that's my wife and kids
You have famliy.
I do indeed.
A beautiful wife, 96 daughters, and one son.
Hohohoho, busy guy.
Then we all share one bathroom. You know that is?
Ya. Don't I know it.
Bathroom.
Nedd?
What? Sweetheart. You know you're on the roof, right?
What's have to know is you need to go to bed. Daddy's having a break down.
Nedd? What are you up to now?
I was just about put the kids bed,
when I got off the roof.
And I that's the that's what happened right.
- Daddy?  - Yes?
- Can I have a glass of water?  - Of course.
- Me too, me three, me four...  - OK.
Hey, JoJo! Wow.
A lot of liquid. A lot of liquid. Just the person I wanted to see.
Yeah. I've realize that we have not been seeing eye to eye lately
and most of it is my fault. It's true.
You know what I've been trying to do?
I have been trying to impose my vision of your future on you.
What me make this perfectly clear
JoJo, you can be whatever kind of Mayor you wanna be.
Hands-on, strong and silent, outspoken, it's up to you.
Well, good
I hear so much better.
I am expecting big things from you young man. Make things.
Alright. Good night.
Good stop! Good talk.
Then, JoJo snuck out feeling lonely and sad and tragedy of misunderstood by his dad.
And where was he going in such a lay down?
Up to Whoville's abandoned star study tower.
A place where the boy felt contented and free.
A place he could be what wanted to be.
And what was inside there I'd say if I could.
But up above，the Kangaroo was up to no good.
Can I come out now, Mom?
No, Rudy. Stay in the room.
- But, Mom?  - Stay inside.
Mr. Vlad Koff?
Eating, go.
Yes. I realize you're busy.
But I need your help.
It's Horton.
He's become obsess with a clover.
And he get actually thinks there are little people on it.
I want that colver destroyed.
Sure, what a big deal this is.For you, bro.
I'd do it myself. But being a lady
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.
But I hear you have no problem with there.
No.
No problem.
Easy busy.
But...
I will only do this for a price.
In exchange for a brand new pair...
No.
This
- little kangaroo.  - Mom?!
Quit, Rudy.
Momy is thinking it over.
We'll thanks but, on second thought
I think I'm going to have the Wickersham Brothers take care of this for me.
Yeah, of course, Wickersham, I mean, they're quasi operation.
You know, they'd... Wait! No!
You can't go over Wickersham.
No No. No no no. Wickershams would be perfect for this job.
But, they are monkeys. It's not scary.
Ah, thanks anyway. Maybe next time.
Wait!
Here is what I gonna do to the precious clover.
I will take it.
I will crush it.
And I will devour it.
Bigger than it looked. One second.
Holy moly.
Then I will regurgitate it.
Then...
I mean I devour it second time.
So two times devour.
Sounds nice.
But I think I'll talk to the Wickershams.
Wait.
Here is best part.
I do all...
Gracious.
That's free, bro.
What do you think?
- Deal.  - Yes. Score. Thank you.
You won't regret.
Mayor?
Mayor?
Open up, Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!
It's snowing in the summer!
Yes.
Yes, it is.
It's a dramatic change in the weather.
As if we're on a speck floating to space.
I don't know how you knew. But, somehow you did.
- Oh, Horton.  - What?
Ah, nothing. I'm on it.
Snow is not lucky.
That's not... Stop.
OK. Anybody else?
Good.
No no. Don't join it. This is not fun.
Uh, this is sign of doomed.
Oh, sweety, that's. No. No no no.
Danger! danger!
Stop having fun immediately!
This is dangerous.
OK.
Horton?
Uh? What?
Hey, there.
We're in big trouble down here.
It's happening. It's snowing in the middle of summer.
It's end of the world!
Hold on here.
I think I know what your problem is.
There, get better?
That seems you have worked.
Ehuh. Do I smell peanuts?
Yes, they are my favorite snack.
But they tender linger.
Ohho! KUh. Debrick, No.
Oh. Hang on Mr. Mayor.
I may have to put up a fight.
Frightened elephant can be very dangerous.
Alright!
You come down the under, buddy.
You hungry for trouble?
I don't know how you can easy self by.
Take a fight.
I hate running.
Morton!
- Don't do that!  - Horton!
Horton? Don't... There you are.
We got trouble. Wait. Stay. Wait. Can you hear that?
No I'm here. OK. Listen. No, go.
Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.
She's telling everyone that you should be kicked out of Nool.
She said that?
I thought we're friends.
Well it is, she's gone to Vlad's.
Vlad. Vlad. I know two Vlads.
Is it the bad Vlad or the bunny Vlad that makes the Cookies?
Yeah, Horton. She's sending you a bunny with cookies.
I think we can assume it's not bad Vlad.
Yeah, that's good call.
So, unless you're cool with giant razor sharp claws,
There be not fights up your body,
if I give her the clover.
I can't.
I promised the Mayor.
I meant what I said. I said what what I meant.
And an elephant's faiths were 100%.
Please, for me, just this once, be faithful 99% of the time.
I've never gone 99% on anything.
I think I'm awesome. So come on.
I meant to what I said and I said what I meant.
I'm gonna say it.
You can do that all days it's not happen then.
- An elephant's faithful 100%.  - That's right.
That's my code. My motto.
But thanks for the warning.
Motto. OK.
But watch the skies. Keep watching the skies.
Mayor, you need to get everyone on the ground,now.
- Two, Three, four...  - I wanna sound the alarm.
There's a good possibility we maybe...maybe attacked by a giant cannibalous bird.
What?
There's small chance it could be bunny with cookies.
But, I wouldn't count on it.
Oh, they are formidable words. mayor
Are you there?
Ya, no. That's a great idea. It just...
in order to get everyone mobilized I need the O.K. of the city council.
And they never listen to me.
I've been called boob. Several times.
- I can't do it.  - You have to talk to them,Mayor.
OK. Listen.
Bad Vlad.
Bad Vlad.
Bad Vlad.
That is definitely not a bunny.
Lost him.
Mean to lose him. And I lost him.
This tree for real, come on!
Hang on, Whoville! This is gonna get rough!
Now you're going to dead end.
Get ready for the best.
Leave me alone!
No! Hold on!
I just know he's gonna jump out somewhere.
Hello?
Chess mate.
Now it's time for me to take clover...
and crush all the little people on a two sang...
Sorry. This is where we get off.
Ah, right in the beak!
Ah. Cool line.
Usually I can think those things to later.
- Mayor?  - Ah, Horton.
Are you OK?
Ah.
Well, more or less.
- What happened? The bird?  - Ya, it attacked me.
Mayor, your people are in danger.
You know what, I'm gonna do it.
I'm going to go out there. And tell them what is going on.
Perfect. Now quick. Get go on.
Hey, Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!
My basement is in the attic.
The science museum is history.
We're lost thousand in this messy.What's going on Mr. Mayor?
I'm declaring a state of emergency.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
The Mayor is just being a moron.
No wait. Whoville is in terrible danger.
Everyone needs get down to the underground storage area immediately.
Time time. Let's do this democratically.
Who wants the joy and glory and festivity of the Whocentennial...
to proceed as planned?
Yeah!
And who, like the Mayor,
thinks it would be better to spend the Whocentennial...
in an underground storage area?
Yeah!
Wait! You got to listen to me.
Our whole world could explode.
Much more quickly.
And our world wouldn't make that noise.
The people have spoken Mr. Mayor.
You're finished.
No one believes you. No one supports you.
- Horton believes me.  - Horton?
Who's Horton?
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky.
Don't bother look. He is invisible.
And he is the one risking his life...
to get Whoville which by the way...
is a speck on a clover just safety.
I can prove it.
Horton's voice comes out of this horn.
Horton!
I have all the Whos gathered in town square.
Let them know you there.
Gee.
It's a kind of high pressure situation then.
Wow. I'm really run a blank here.
I know.
Horton?
Horton, We're waiting.
Time to show everyone that you exist and...
By extension what a none boob I am.
Wait!
Everyone look at the wind. What do you think that means?
It means, Um, it means... obviously, uh...
Let's the Kite Flying Race begins!
What a perron on you Horton! Ha Ha Ha!
Woo, brain freeze!
Give Me Back...
- My Speck!  - Not this time, guy.
I'm so sorry that I let you down, but...
this... this is bigger than me.
Get the famliy together and get some where safe.
I will!
I believe you.
I've got you now, innocent.
No, No, No!
Oh, no.
Mayor?
Anybody there?
Anyone?
But clover by clover by clover he found
But the one that he sought for was just not around.
Mayor?
Hello?
And by noon، poor Horton more dead and alive,
Had picked, searched, and filed up 9005.
Hello.
Sorry to bother you.
Nobody.
Knock knock.
This is the way you take.
Whos there?
If there were any Whos there,
You get it! Whos there.
I can't give up have them with you.
All day he looked. Looked on and on.
Till his hope was almost gone.
No. No. No. Please No!
Ah, This is unfiar!
But wait!
Could this one be the one? Was all this searching finally done?
Ah, yes, for this was the hour...
Horton have found from the 3 millions flowers.
Mayor?
Mayor! I found you!
Mayor?
Are you there?
Mayor.
Mayor.
Mayor, are you there?
Mayor.
Ah, no. This is Floyd.
Can I take a message?
Mayor!
You're Okay!
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!
Sorry.
It must have been very rough down there.
I can't believe I've found you.
You really have me worried.
Say. The Mayor was right!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
OK. I'm alright and so are you.
Citizens of Whoville!
I'd like you to meet our friend Horton.
He's going to help us.
Heevham I've got this.
This is the chairman.
Idiot! You're finished this town.
Is that understood? Finished. You Boob!
Huhuh I'm just joking.
Good one.
Horton, this is my wife Sally.
You exist! This means my husband isn't in crazy.
Hooray!
And... off you my daughters.
- Haley, Holy, Hooly, Hilder and Heddy.  - Hi!
And here is Miss. Yelp, my loyal assistant.
- And here's Dr. Larue.  - You saved us.
And Bert from accounting. And Mrs. McQuilligan.
And Mr. Farfoogan from the Cloogan Farfoogans.
And the old man in bathtub.
Let's not overwhelm the poor fella.
He's never gonna remember all these names.
Well. I'll try my best.
Sally.
Chairman.
Haley, Hooly, Holy, Hilder, Heddy.Miss Yelp, Dr. Larue,
Bert from accounting, Mrs. McQuilligany,
Mr. Farfoogan of the Cloogan Farfoogans.
And wan't there an old guy in a shower.
- Um, bathtub.  - Oh, Yeah!
We're all here, Horton.
And, We all believe in you.
Wow! That's awesome.
And it's reponsibility I do not take lightly.
I promise you a future that it's safe, sound, and stable.
We will create a world where every Who is undoubt with 3 inalienable rights...
To be determined that a later date.
And we will put a speck on Mountain Nool before the end of this, uh, decade.
Oh!
This, this is the elephant who is crazy. Oh my goodness.
I got to tell anyone. I think it's the kangaroo.
Quick to they find out of them.
Hoho, you should've been seeing me.
I really read the elephant habit.
I chase him, I torment him and then I break him into million little elephant pieces.
It was thing of beauty, Really. My best work.
Classic Vlad.
- And the colver?　 - Clover is finished.
No vain million years Horton finds it.
Believe my beak. Clover is gone forever.
I just saw Horton. And he is still talking to that clover.
Idiot!
Whoa, come on.
Hang you, Bro. It's me you're talking to. We have history.
Come on. Let's don't forget I did this for Free.
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?
There once was a time when people were people.
And specks were specks.
Well, I say, you can't see it, hear it, or feel it it doesn't exist.
Our way of life is under attack.
And who's leading that attack?
Horton!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute!
This is Horton we're talking about you'll know about him.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.Except for that fly city he sat on.
He didn't that on purpose.
- Shut up, mouse.  - Oh, Yeah. That's weird.
I feel my brain is burning. I got to go.
Are we going to let troublemakers، like Horton poison the minds of children?
Not the children!
When Horton tells our children about worlds beyond the jungle,
it makes them question authority.
Which leads to the fires, which leads to shocking!
Yeah! Horton must pay!
Eat that speck!
We have to do something!
- For the children!  - For the children!
Are we going to let him get away with this?
No!
Morton! I told you 100%!
Horton.
- Morton, pick up your feet, Gee.  - It's not me.
Oh, Hoho. I see. It's an angry mob.
Sorry Morton.I thought it's you who's making all the...
But it's...
Hold on.
Run, Horton!
There he is!
Let's rope him!
Let's take him!
Stop!
Hey, fellas.
Good to see ya.
All at once.
You're look really great as herd.
Horton, Horton, Horton look at that mess you created for yourself.
All this hullabaloo over us is a silly little flower.
It's a speck.
Right.
I mean it's silly, really, all this talk of roping you and caging you and well
we don't need to go into the details.
The point is this angry mob of all a trouble you're in.
It can all go away.
- Really?  - Of course.
All you have to do is admit to everyone
that there are no little people living on that speck.
That you're wrong and I was right.
You do that,
and things can go the right back to the way they were.
But, if you don't,
You're going to have to pay the price.
So I just have to say it isn't true?
Go ahead! Rope me! Cage me! Do whatever you want!
But there are people on this speck.
And they have Mayor.
Who has 96 daughters and one son name JoJo,
Who all share a bathroom whatever that is.
And even though you can't hear or see them at all,
Person's a person, no matter how small.
That was beautiful, Horton.
Rope him! Cage him!
Burn that speck in a pot of boiling pees on that oil!
They don't believe we're here.
We've got to make some noise!
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.
Come on!
Everybody!
We are here. We are here. We are here.
This is what takes you never make up stories about people on specks!
Listen. There they are!
- Rope him!  - Cage him!
It's not working.
I can hear you. But, their ears aren't strong enough.
We need to be louder.
Get every Who'd make noise! Everyone!
We are here. We are here. We are here.
JoJo, where're you going?
We need every voice, JoJo!
You need to make some noise down there. Or we all be destroyed.
The Mayor grabbed the tamtam starting to smack it.
And all over Whoville, They ooped up all racket.
They rattle tin kettles, they beat on brass pans,
On garbage-fill tops, old cranberry cans.
They blew on byzu bilzl brasstic big tubas.
On druming Soompazum, Boompazum, plutes
There!
Can they hear us now?
Listen! Please!
It's the most beautiful thing ever!
I don't hear nothing!
I don't think so.
But, keep trying.
I'll never give...in!
Are you sure that every Who down in the Whoville is trying?
Where's JoJo?
Probably up the old observatory.
Hey, there's our limit.
That's not supposed to stretch that far!
JoJo!
You built this?
We are here. We are here. We are here.
You're making a mistake.
- Mom!
This doesn't concern you, sweety. Back in your pouch!
Everybody, don't stop!
Keep going! This gonna do it!
- Can they hear?  - No!
No matter what happens, I couldn't ask for a better son.
Ah, hey, JoJo?
Come on! Keep going!
NO!
We are here.We are here.We are here.
No.
We are here.We are here.We are here.
NO!
We are here.We are here.We are here.
I hear it! I hear it! They are there!
And that yelp.
That one small extra yelp put it over.
And all the Who noises brust out of the clover.
- I hear it, too.  - Me too, wide.
Rudy. Give me that! Come Ru...
Rudy, get back in the pouch now.
No, Mom.
Uh, Wickersams, get that clover.
What the...E..Anybody take it from him.
You did it, Mayor.
You did it.
We did it!
Yeah!
Well done, son.
Alright, Mayor!
Dad, you're one of the Greats.
Wow! Easy everyone. Easy!
Oh hi, Vlad.
Well, I shouldn't. But,
Oh man, that is nice touch.
I'm a mess with this. I am not emotional.
Here comes the water slide.
And someone if you want thank
The good people of nool
who put me on a cage and poke me with sticks
That was me!
My buddy more than for being the only who stood by me.
Well, not right by me he's hidden in the bushs
Sending me good thoughts.
He's small.
Dude. You're a warrior poet.
And most of all I'd like to thank to the Mayor of Whoville.
- Who believed me from the beginning.  - Oh, Horton.
We're going to miss you.
Hmm. Gee
What are we gonna do without you, Horton?
Ah, don't worry.
I always be around.
# And even as I wonder, #
# I'll keep you in sight. #
#  Keeping in them sight. #
- # On a cool dark winter's night. #  - Beautiful metaphor.
# And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might. #
Uh, that's a little high funny.
# Baby, I can't fight this feeling any more. #
# I've forgotten what I started fighting for. #
# And if I have to crawl upon the floor. #
- # Come crashing through your door. #  - # Crashing through your door. #
# Baby I can't fight this feeling any more. #
# I can't fight this feeling any more. #
And so all ended well for those Horton and Whos.
And for all in the jungle, even Kangaroos.
So let that be a lesson to one and to all.
A person's a person.
No matter how small.
MAN 1 [ON TV]: Spring training camp and he's definitely got the inside track.
Word is that they're having some problems with injuries.
MAN 2: Really? Are they looking into...
...free-agent signings last second, anything like that?
MAN 1: Possibly, and they've got a strong farm club too.
They've got some triple-A ballplayers they might bring up.
Peter would certainly be able to tell us more about that.
MAN 2: Who do you like?
MAN 1: So far, I like what I'm seeing in New York.
They've got a strong ball club, as usual. That's in the American.
And in the National, I'm still liking Chicago...
...with a little bit of a twist here for Los Angeles.
MAN 2: Okay, so we're looking at New York-Chicago World Series...
...possible Los Angeles. MAN 1: Could be a dark horse.
MAN 2: Hold him to it at the end of the season.
That's gonna do it for us from the Sports Desk.
- Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave. MAN 1: Thanks for nothing, Eddie.
MAN 3: Thank you, guys. That's not all we're following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk.
The world of medicine has seen its share of miracle cures...
...from the polio vaccine to heart transplants...
...but all past achievements may pale in comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.
Thank you for joining us this morning.
- Not at all. - So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.
Well, the premise is quite simple.
Take something designed by nature and reprogram it...
...to make it work for the body rather than against it.
- We're talking about a virus? - Yes.
In this case, the measles virus...
...which has been engineered at a genetic level to be helpful rather than harmful.
Um, I'm not... I find the best way to describe it is...
...if you can imagine your body as a highway...
...and you picture the virus as a very fast car being driven by a very bad man...
...imagine the damage that that car could cause.
But then if you replace that man with a cop...
...the picture changes. And that's essentially what we've done.
Now, how many people have you treated so far?
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials in humans so far.
- And how many are cancer-free? - Ten thousand and nine.
So you have actually cured cancer?
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.
What you see? What you see?
Damn.
Let's go, Sam.
Come on.
Good morning, Matt. It's looking great, I'll tell you.
Not only was this the biggest snowstorm in New York City history...
...it had to be one of the prettiest. Imagine waking up on Sunday...
...to 26.9 inches of snow in New York City.
ROBERT: Here you go. Just the way you like it.
Disgusting.
Excuse me, excuse me.
All right. Come on, relax.
CURRY [ON TV]: However, it did strand planes, trains and automobiles.
There was a report, a Turkish Airlines flight skidded off the runway at JFK.
No one was injured, but for the most part, Matt...
There you go.
I'm gonna show you, attempting the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.
And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.
In New York, in 30 Rock, we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.
Back to you, Matt and Katie.
Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be beautiful for the next day, at least.
- And then it turns brown. COURIC: If that.
Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.
Don't just push them around, eat them. I'm not playing.
WOMAN: Good morning. This morning, all up the East Coast...
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables. We will sit down here all night.
The biggest challenge is getting back to work.
What are you whining about? Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?
Hey. All right, here's the deal. Look. Look.
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables tomorrow night. All right?
Deal? Deal?
Come on.
ROBERT [SINGING]: Don't worry About a thing
'Cause every little thing Gonna be all right
I know that feels good.
Smiled with the rising sun Three little birds
Ah, Sam.
Singin' sweet songs Of melody...
I'm all right.
I'm all right, it's all right.
What's happening? I tried to reach you on your cell. I get a recording.
- Cell service is down. - Where are we going?
- Can't get used to the new regs. ROBERT: Going to Aunt Sara's.
- Ma! No! Why? - Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.
MAN: We're at 30 minutes, colonel. - Copy.
- Thirty minutes to what? - They're sealing off the island.
- Seal off the island? This island? - But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.
ROBERT: Did you bring all the money? ZOE: Yeah.
ROBERT: How much? ZOE: Six hundred.
Why did you say, "You're going"?
ROBERT: That's not enough. - Robert.
You said, "You're going," not, "We're going."
When you get across, I need you to get to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.
Take Sara's car, go upstate. I'll meet you at the farm.
Bring enough food for two weeks.
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?
Is it airborne?
MARLEY: But we only go to Aunt Sara's in the summer.
- It may be. - Oh, my God.
- It's Christmas. What about my presents? - He's announcing it.
PRESIDENT [O VER RADIO]: Make no mistake, Americans, this virus...
You left my Christmas presents in the closet.
Hush now, Mar.
- Threatens the survival of not only our nation, but of every other nation...
- Mommy, look, it's a butterfly. - Marley, enough!
And so it is with great sadness, but even greater resolve...
...that tonight I have signed an executive order...
...initiating a military quarantine of New York City.
God be with us.
ANNOUNCER: This has been a special...
The window is still open. We find something in a week or two weeks...
...we can reverse the spread.
I can still fix this.
Please. You can do the same work outside the city.
This is ground zero. This is my site. We talked about this.
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm not gonna let this happen.
Let? This isn't up to you. You can't control...
MARLEY: Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!
ROBERT: How'd you sleep?
Look out. Come on, you know better than that.
Uh-uh.
I'll be back.
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012, GA series, serum 391.
Animal trials. Streaming video.
[RATS SCREAMING AND GROWLING]
GA series results appear typical.
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...
...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.
Compounds 2, 5, 7...
...12, 13, 15, 17...
...all killed the host.
Hold on a second.
Compound 6 appears to be showing decreased aggression response.
Partial pigmentation return.
Slight pupil constriction.
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6...
...next candidate for human trials.
You hang in there, number six.
Yeah, that's what you want.
[BOB MARLEY'S "THREE LITTLE BIRDS" PLAYS ON CAR STEREO]
Hey!
Good morning, Marge. Good morning, Fred.
What are you guys doing here so early?
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred. Don't set it down anywhere.
I'll see you guys inside.
What's happening, buddy?
Yes.
Good morning, Hank. I'm midway through the G's.
Hey, who's the girl in?
Never mind. Hey, I'll see you in the morning.
What am I supposed to say?
Hello.
Wanna see some infected rats?
Okay, tomorrow. I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.
Psst.
Come here. Hey. Hey.
Good job. You did so good.
Yes. Yes.
Ah.
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.
You'll get some of that later.
Let's go.
Wait.
ROBERT [ON RECORDING]: My name is Robert Neville.
I am a survivor living in New York City.
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.
I will be at the South Street Seaport every day at midday...
...when the sun is highest in the sky.
If you are out there...
If anyone is out there...
I can provide food.
I can provide shelter.
I can provide security.
If there's anybody out there...
...anybody...
Please.
You are not alone.
Fore!
Yeah.
Keep your eye on this one for me.
Ooh.
I'm getting good.
Ss-ss.
Sam! No, no, no!
No! No! Sam!
No! No!
Sam? Sam? Sam?
Sam? Sam?
Sam? Sam?
Hello, Sam?
Sam?
Sam?
Come on. Sam.
I gotta go, Sam.
I gotta go. I gotta go.
Sam?
Sam? Sam?
Sam? Sam?
Sam. Sam.
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go. Sam.
What are you doing?
Sam, we gotta go!
Sam, go! Go!
Sam, get out! Get out!
You gotta pay attention, okay? You gotta pay attention.
Listen, uh...
...I want you to stay here on this one, okay?
Because you can still get infected.
And I can't.
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...
...just go.
Okay. Subject is female. Likely 18 to 20 years of age.
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively at six times human dose.
Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit. Pulse, 200 bpm.
Respiration elevated.
PA 02, 300 percent of normal.
Pupils fully dilated.
Nonreactive to light.
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.
Symptoms and tissue samples confirm subject is infected with KV.
Vaccine test.
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.
Commencing human trials.
Respiration slowing.
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...
...105...
...104 and decreasing.
We may have something here.
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6 ineffective on humans.
Test results linked to this entry saved on six redundant drives.
Still no cure.
ROBERT: Day 1001.
We came in close contact with a hive today.
Blood tests confirm that I remain immune to both the airborne...
...and contact strains.
Canines remain immune to airborne strain only.
You can't go running into the dark, dummy.
Vaccine trials continue.
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity to infected hosts.
The Krippin Virus is...
...elegant.
Just fishing in the dark, son.
Mm. A behavioral note, um:
An infected male exposed himself to sunlight today.
Now, it's possible decreased brain function...
...or the growing scarcity of food is causing them to...
...ignore their basic survival instincts.
Social de-evolution appears complete.
Typical human behavior is now entirely absent.
Why are we stopping?
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.
- We got less than 10 minutes. - Baby, give me the dog.
- Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go. MARLEY: Daddy!
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.
MIKE: Keep the colonel and his family between us and don't let anyone stop you.
MARLEY: Mommy, they have guns!
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.
MAN 1 [O VER LOUDSPEAKER]: Unless you have clearance...
...you cannot pass the checkpoint. Please return to your homes.
MIKE: Make a hole, make a hole! Coming through!
Coming through!
MAN 1: Unless you have clearance, you cannot pass the checkpoint.
Please return to your homes.
MAN 2: You're clear. Move ahead.
You're clear.
MAN 3: All right, that's it, move up.
All right, step up.
You're clear. Next. Let's go.
No good.
MAN 4: Military quarantine is about to begin.
MAN 5: Come on, step back.
- Military quarantine is about to begin. - Look, look, look.
WOMAN: I'm not infected. MAN 2: Clear. Good, go on.
I'm not infected.
Please! Please!
- Please take my baby. Take my baby, please. MAN 5: You're gonna have to move back.
- No good. MAN 6: Follow me, ma'am.
ZOE: What? No! Robert! Robert!
Get your hands off my wife. Get your hands off.
- Mommy! MIKE: Stand down.
Lieutenant...
- Mommy! - Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!
Get your hands off of my wife.
MIKE: Stand down! - Scan her again. Stand down!
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!
I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville. I am ordering you to scan her again.
Scan her again!
All right, scan her again.
- It's clear. - It's clear. Move through.
Who's next? Come on.
Take my baby with you! Please! Please!
- Mommy! - Please take my baby. Please!
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?
MAN 4: Stay away from the shoreline.
How long?
Five minutes. We'll make it.
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.
Military quarantine is about to begin.
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel. You got my word on it.
ROBERT: Give me a kiss.
[MOUTHS] I love you. I love you.
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...
...and keep him strong through the struggles ahead.
Lord, please just bring him home safely. Amen.
Daddy's gonna make the monsters go away, baby, okay?
Sam, you protect Daddy.
- No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog. MAN 7: Sir, we gotta go!
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.
[MOUTHS] It's a butterfly.
All right, come on, let's go!
[WATCH BEEPING]
How'd you sleep?
Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look at the ongoing mutations...
...of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed miracle cure for cancer.
So far, almost 5000 patients treated with her retrofitted virus...
...have begun exhibiting symptoms resembling the early onset of rabies.
Twenty-five patients have already died.
Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals to stockpile antiviral drugs...
...and to begin preliminary quarantine protocols.
It's my birthday.
We are fully confident Dr. Neville can see us through these...
You gonna sing?

They don't know where I live.
Don't... Don't let them track us.
You gotta stay out till dawn.
No!
MAN [ON TV]: Donkey?
What are you doing?
I would think of all people you would recognize a wall when you see one.
Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.
DONKEY: It is. Around your half, see? That's your half, this is my half.
SHREK: Oh, your half? Hm. DONKEY: Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty.
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.
SHREK: Back off! DONKEY: No, you back off.
SHREK: This is my swamp! DONKEY: Our swamp.
- Smelly ogre. SHREK: Fine!
DONKEY: Come back, I'm not through with you!
SHREK: Well, I'm through with you.
DONKEY: You know, with you it's always "me, me, me."
Well, guess what, now it's my turn. So you just shut up and pay attention!
You are mean to me! You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do.
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
DONKEY: Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!
SHREK: Oh, yeah.
You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...
...for stabbing me in the back!
DONKEY: You're so wrapped up in layers, you're afraid of your own feelings.
SHREK: Go away. DONKEY: See?
Doing it again, just like you did to Fiona...
...and all she did was like you, maybe love you.
SHREK: Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.
I heard the two of you talking.
DONKEY: She wasn't talking about you, she was talking about somebody else.
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.
Obviously you know that.
They're yours.
But I did find bacon, which is about the most fantastic thing in history.
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.
I put by your plate, because your leg is okay...
...but it won't be for very long if you don't start a course soon.
ROBERT: Who are you?
ANNA: I'm Anna and that's Ethan.
Don't let it get cold.
It's okay. Go on.
We came from Maryland. We heard your message on the radio.
We were at the pier at noon. We waited all day.
We're going to Vermont.
To the survivors' colony.
What?
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.
There's no survivors' colony, there's no safe zones.
Nothing happened the way it was supposed to.
Nothing worked the way it was supposed to.
In the mountains. There's a whole colony of people there who didn't get sick.
The virus couldn't survive the cold. There's a colony...
ROBERT: Shut up! Shut up!
Everybody's dead.
Everybody is dead.
I just need... I need a minute. Okay?
Just...
I just... I was saving that bacon.
I was saving it.
I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs. All right? Just...
I'm gonna go.
Ethan, put the knife down.
[MUSIC PLAYS ON TV]
MAN [ON TV]: You there! Ogre. SHREK: Aye.
MAN: By the order of Lord Farquaad...
...I am authorized to place you both under arrest...
...and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.
Oh, really? You and what army?
Can I say something to you?
You was really, really something back there. Incredible.
Are you talking to...
...me?
Yes, I was talking to you. You was really great back there.
Those guards, they thought they was all that. You showed up, and bam!
Tripping over themselves like babes in the woods.
That really made me feel good to see that.
That's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free.
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
Hm?
But, uh...
...I don't have any friends.
And I'm not going out there by myself.
Wait a minute. I got a great idea. I'll stick with you!
DONKEY: You a mean, green fighting machine.
Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.
I like Shrek.
DONKEY: That was really scary. If you don't mind me saying...
...if that don't work, your breath will get the job done...
...because you definitely need some tic tacs, because your breath stinks!
Man, you almost burned the hair out of my nose. Just like the time...
You're not so good with people anymore, are you?
Thank you for my leg.
Okay.
Where have you been?
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship out of Sao Paulo.
Those boats weren't meant to be permanent.
No, they weren't.
When the Navy fell apart, we started docking to take on supplies.
Someone picked it up on shore. Five of us were immune.
You said five?
The Darkseekers got them.
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?
It's too late today.
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can make it to Vermont in a straight shot.
- So if you had... - I'm not leaving.
This is ground zero.
This is my site.
I'm not gonna let this happen.
I can still fix this.
ROBERT: Whoa. You scared me. - Sorry.
I called down twice.
Oh. Oh, thank you.
It's heavily sedated. Don't worry, it's safe.
I've never seen one so still.
They're always biting.
You think that can cure her?
Um... No, this will almost certainly kill it...
...but it's possible by drastically reducing the body temperature...
...I can increase the compound's effectiveness.
Did all of them die?
Yes.
ANNA: My God.
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.
Where can Ethan sleep?
He's heavy.
Can you get that?
She's beautiful.
What's her name?
Marley.
- Her name was Marley. - It's a beautiful name.
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.
- Who? - Uh, the singer.
Damian?
Uh, his father.
His father.
Nope.
[SINGING] I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot the deputy
- Oh, that is unacceptable. - What?
Best album ever made.
[BOB MARLEY'S "STIR IT UP" PLAYS ON STEREO]
- You don't recognize that? - Mm-mm.
Wow.
He had this idea, it was kind of a virologist's idea.
He believed that you could cure racism and hate. Literally cure it...
...by injecting music and love into people's lives.
One day, he was scheduled to perform at a peace rally.
Gunmen came to his house and shot him down.
Two days later...
...he walked out on that stage and sang.
Somebody asked him why.
He said, "The people...
...who are trying to make this world worse are not taking a day off.
How can I?"
Light up the darkness.
Come with us, Neville.
To the colony.
There's no colony, Anna.
Everything just fell apart.
- There was no evacuation plan... - You're wrong. There is a colony.
I know, okay?
How do you know, Anna?
I just know.
How? I said, how do you know? How could you know?
God told me.
He has a plan.
- God told you? - Yes.
- The God? - Yes.
- I know how this sounds. - It sounds crazy.
But something told me to turn on the radio.
Something told me to come here.
My voice on the radio told you to come here, Anna.
You were trying to kill yourself last night?
Anna.
I got here just in time to save your life. That's a coincidence?
- Just stop it. Stop it. Stop. - He must have sent me here for a reason.
Neville, the world is quieter now.
You just have to listen.
If we listen...
...we can hear God's plan.
- God's plan? - Yeah.
All right. Let me tell you about your God's plan.
There were 6 billion people on Earth when the infection hit.
KV had a 90 percent kill rate. That's 5.4 billion...
...people dead.
Crashed and bled out, dead.
Less than 1 percent immunity.
That left 12 million healthy people like you, me and Ethan.
The other 588 million...
...turned into your Darkseekers.
And then they got hungry.
And they killed and fed on everybody.
Everybody!
Every single person that you or I has ever known...
...is dead!
Dead!
There is no God. There is no God.
What is that?
Was it still dark when you brought us home last night?
You were bleeding. There was light on the horizon.
Turn the light off. Turn it off.
They followed us home.
Ethan.
Shit.
Anna.
Anna.
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
Anna?
Anna.
Come on. Come on.
- Are you okay? You all right? ANNA: Yeah.
Are you all right?
- You okay? - Oh, my God. You're bleeding.
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!
Get to the lab! To the lab!
Get behind the Plexi.
Oh, my God. Come on.
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.
Oh, my God.
It's working.
Neville...
...it's working.
No! Stop! Stop!
Look, look, look, I can save you.
I can sa... I can help you. You are sick and I can help you.
I can... I can fix this!
I can save everybody!
I can fix everything! It's working. It's working!
Stop! Stop!
Let me save you! Let me save you!
No, no!
No, no!
MARLEY: Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

- What are you doing? - The cure is in her blood.
Coal chute. I think it'll be safe. Ethan, get in!
- Go. - Come on, get in.
- Get in. - Anna.
I think this is why you're here.
What are you doing?
I'm listening.
- Neville, there's room. Come! - No.
They're not gonna stop. They're not gonna stop.
Stay in till dawn.
ANNA: In 2009, a deadly virus burned through our civilization...
...pushing humankind to the edge of extinction.
Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life...
...to the discovery of a cure...
...and the restoration of humanity.
On September 9th, 2012...
...at approximately 8:49 p. M...
...he discovered that cure.
And at 8:52, he gave his life to defend it.
We are his legacy.
This is his legend.

Oh, my God!
Stay away from the gas! Stay there!
Help! Help!
Somebody, help me!
Help, help!
Oh, my leg!
Hey, get over here. Give me a hand.
You, come on! Come over here! Give me a hand!
On the count of three.
One, two, three!
Help! Please, help me!
Help me! Please, help me!Dialogue:
Get him out of here. Get him away from the engine.
Get him out of here.
Help me! Please, help me. I'm having contractions!
How many months pregnant are you?
Only eight months.
How far apart are they coming?
I don't know, a few just happened!
Hey! Get away from there!
Listen to me!
Look at me! You're gonna be okay. Do you understand me?
But you have to sit absolutely still.
Hey! You! Come here!
I need you to get this woman away from these fumes.
Take her there. Stay with her.
If her contractions occur closer than three minutes, call me!
You gotta be kidding me.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
Hey! What's your name?
Stop! Her head's not tilted back enough. You're blowing into her stomach.
You sure?
That's exactly what I was doing.
I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.
You need to think about giving that license back.
Maybe we should do one of those hole things.
Stick the pen in the throat?
Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.
Does anyone have any pens? Do you have a pen?
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Big deep breaths.
Big breaths.
Move! Move! Move!
Get her up! Get her out of there! Go away!
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
You?
Stay with her.
Dude, I'm not going anywhere.
I didn't know which one would work best.
They're all OK.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Did you ever use a needle?
What?
Did you ever patch a pair of jeans?
I, uh...
I made the drapes in my apartment.
That's fantastic. Listen...
Do you have a second? I could use a little help here.
Help with what?
With this.
I'd do it myself, I'm a doctor, but I just can't reach it.
You want me to sew that?
Like the drapes.
No, I used a sewing machine.
No, you can do this, I'm telling you.
If you wouldn't mind.
Of course I will.
Thank you.
It's for your hand.
Save me some... for there...for the wound.
Any color preference?
No. Standard black.
Hey, you!
What's your name?
Me? Charlie.
Charlie, we need help with the fire. No one will see it if it isn't big.
Okay, I'm on it.
What's your name?
Sayid. I'm on it, Sayid.
I might throw up on you.
You're doing fine.
You don't seem afraid at all.
I don't understand that.
Well, fear's sort of an odd thing.
When I was in residency,
my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16-year-old kid.
A girl.
And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I...
I accidentally ripped her dural sack.
It's at the base of the spine where all the nerves come together.
Membrane as thin as tissue, and...
So it ripped open.
Nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta,
spinal fluid flowing out of her and I...
The terror was just so...crazy, so real...and I knew I had to deal with it.
So I just made a choice.
I'd let the fear in. Let it take over. Let it do its thing.
But only for five seconds, that's all I was gonna give it.
So I started to count.
One, two, three, four, five.
And it was gone.
I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.
If that had been me, I think I would've run for the door.
No, I don't think that's true.
You're not running now.
You think they would have come by now.
Hmm? Who?
Anyone.
As if I'm gonna start eating chocolate.
Shannon, we may be here for a while.
The plane had a black box, idiot.
They know exactly where we are, they're coming.
I'll eat on the rescue boat.
I'll eat on the rescue boat.
Hungry?
Yeah. Thanks.
Any more...you know, baby stuff?
No... I'm okay.
Well, hang in there.
Yeah, you too.
You sure you're warm enough?
Do you think he's gonna live?
Do you know him?
He was sitting next to me.
We must've been at about 40,000 feet when it happened.
We hit an air pocket and dropped...maybe 200 feet.
The turbulence was...
I blacked out.
I didn't.
I saw the whole thing.
I knew that the tail was gone, but I...couldn't bring myself to look back.
And then the front end of the plane broke off.
Well, it's not here on the beach.
Neither is the tail.
We need to figure out which way we came in.
Why?
There's a chance we find the cockpit.
If it's intact, we might be able to find the transceiver.
We could send out a signal, help the rescue party find us.
How do you know all that?
I took a couple of flying lessons.
Wasn't for me.
I saw some smoke...just through the valley.
If you're thinking about going for the cockpit, I'm going with you.
I don't know your name.
I'm Kate.
What was that?
That was weird, right?
Did anybody see that?
Yeah.
Terrific.
So, how's the drink?
It's good.
That wasn't a very strong reaction.
Well, it's not a very strong drink.
Just don't tell anyone.
This, of course, breaks some critical FAA regulations.
Excuse me.
Sir, excuse me!
Guess he really had to go.
Sir, excuse me!
Ladies and gentlment
The pilot has switched on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.
Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
It's normal.
Oh, I know. I've just never been a very good flier.
My husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air.
Well, he sounds like a very smart man.
Be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
Well, I'll keep you company until he does.
Don't worry. It's gonna be over...
It didn't sound like an animal, not exactly.
I keep thinking there was something familiar about it.
Where you from?
Bronx.
Monkeys.
Monkey Island. Don't know if we're on an island...
You ready?
You showed me where the smoke was. I can get there myself.
I'm coming.
Well, you're gonna need better shoes.
Whatever it was, it wasn't natural.
Does anyone have any sunblock?
Yes I do.
So I was just looking inside the fuselage.
It's pretty grim in there.
You think we should do something about the...B-O-D-Y-S?
What are you spelling, man, "bodies"?
B-O-D-I-E-S.
That sounds like a good idea.
No, they'll deal with it when they get here.
I'm gonna go out and look for the cockpit.
See if we can find a transceiver to send a distress signal.
Help the rescue team.
You need to keep an eye on the wounded.
If the guy in the suit wakes up, keep him calm,
but don't let him remove that shrapnel. Understand?
Got it.
What about the guy with the leg? The tourniquet...?
I stopped the bleeding. I took it off last night.
He should be all right.
Yeah, cool. Good job.
I'll come with. I wanna help.
I don't need any more help.
No, it's cool. I don't really feel like standing still, so...
Excellent.
Can I ask you something?
Me? I'd be thrilled. I've been waiting.
Have we ever met anywhere?
No. That would be unlikely.
I look familiar though, right?
Yeah.
You can't quite place it?
No, I can't.
Yeah, I think I know.
You do?
Never heard that song?
I've heard it. I don't know what that...
That's us! Drive Shaft!
The ring.
Second tour of Finland.
Never heard of Drive Shaft?
The band?
Yeah, the band.
You were in Drive Shaft?
I am in Drive Shaft. I play bass.
Serious?
Yeah. Charlie.
Track three. I do backing vocals.
My friend Beth would freak. She loves you guys.
Give me Beth's number, I'll call. I'd love to.
You ever heard of Drive Shaft?
We gotta keep moving.
They were good.
They are good. Still together.
We're in the middle of a comeback.
You guys, is this normal?
Kind of day turning into night,
You know, end of the world-type weather.
Is this...Guys?
I'm telling you, you don't wanna go in there! There's too many bodies!
There it is again.
Oh, my God.
Well, let's do this.
Let's get this trans...
Transceiver.
Transceiver thing and get out of here.
Come on!
You okay?
Yeah, you?
Yeah.
I'm fine. Charlie's fine, by the way. I'm okay.
Hey, you don't have to come up here.
No, I'm good.
So, what does a transceiver look like?
Like a complicated walkie-talkie.
Hey, can you hear me?
I need that water.
Here. Here you go.
How many survived?
At least 48.
Does anything feel broken?
No, no. Just my head's a little dizzy, that's all.
It's probably a concussion.
How long has it been?
Sixteen hours.
Not yet.
Six hours in...our radio went out.
No one could see us.
We turned back to land in Fiji.
By the time we hit turbulence...we were a thousand miles off course.
They're looking for us in the wrong place.
We have a transceiver.
Good, good. We were hoping.
You shouldn't move.
No, no. I'm okay.
Transceiver's right there.
It's right there.
It's not working.
What were you doing in the bathroom?
What?
What the hell was that?
It's right outside.
What? What's right out...?
What the hell just happened?
Jack, come on!
Just leave it!
Okay, run!
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
I don't know.
Did you see him?
He pulled me up.
Where is he?
I don't know!
How can you not know?
We got separated!
I fell down.
He came back. That thing was...
Did you see it?
No. No. But it was right there.
We were dead... I was. And then Jack came back and he pulled me up.
I don't know where he is.
We have to go back for him.
Go back? There?
There's a certain gargantuan quality about this thing.
Then don't come.
I heard you shout.
I heard you shout "Jack."
I'm Charlie, by the way.
What is that?
What is...?
It's the pilot.
Did you see it?
No. It was right behind me, but I dove into the bushes.
Guys...how does something like that happen?
Ladies and gentlemen,  please fasten your seatbelts.
It's normal.
Previously on  Lost...
Stay there!
I'm having contractions.
You're gonna be okay.
Do you have a second? I could use a little help here.
Look,  I'd do it myself,
You want me to sew that up?
You don't seem afraid at all.
I don't understand that.
They know exactly where we are.
They're coming.
You'd think they would have come by now.
Did anybody see that?
Terrific.
I'm gonna go out and look for the cockpit.
See if we can find a transceiver
to send a distress signal.
Kate, you showed me where the smoke was.
I can get there myself.
I'm coming.
Hey, guys, is this normal?
Day turning into night,
You know, end of the world-type weather? Is this...guys?
We were 1,000 miles off course.
They're looking for us in the wrong place.
What were you doing in the bathroom?
What?
What the hell was that?
What the hell just happened?
How does something like that happen?
Anything?
You keep asking if there's anything.
Pardon me for appearing desperate,
but before the pilot was ripped from the cockpit,
he did say that no one's gonna find us
unless we get that transceiver working.
So...
Is there anything?
No.
Okay.
So what were you doing in the bathroom?
Thought you could tell.
I was getting sick.
Puking.
My one tangible contribution to the trek.
No, I'm glad you came, Charlie.
Every trek needs a coward.
You're not a coward.
Are you all right, sir?
I'm good.
Thanks.
Can I get you a water?
I'm fine. Thank you.
Please?
All right.
Excuse me.
Sir? Excuse me!
Sir, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentleman,
the captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.
Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
Sir? Are you all right?
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
I'm gonna have to ask that you open the door.
Open the door now, sir.
Sir?
Hey. We're going through some clothes. Sorting them.
I see you found your bag.
Come on, you wanna give us a hand?
Not really.
You're wasting your time. They're coming.
Is that your boyfriend?
My brother. Boone.
God's friggin' gift to humanity.
I used to have a stomach.
Do you know what it is?
Not yet.
I haven't felt the baby move since yesterday.
Excuse me.
Have you seen my boy?
Sorry.
Come here, boy.
What did I tell you after what's happened?
I thought Vincent would be around.
Stay on the beach.
I thought this would be okay.
Don't do that.
You listen to me, I mean what I say. You understand?
What is this?
I just found 'em.
Come here.
Hey, guys, come on.
Hey! Break it up!
Break it up! Get off!
Break up! That's it! It's over! That's it!
I'm sick of this redneck!
Want some more?
Tell everyone what you told me!
Tell them that I crashed the plane! Go on!
The shoe fits!
What is going on?
What is going on?
My kid found these in the jungle.
This guy was in the back row of business class the whole flight.
Never got up.Hands folded underneath the blanket.
And for some reason, just pointing this out,
The guy next to him didn't make it.
Thank you for observing.
Don't think I saw them pull you out of line before we boarded?
Come on! Bring it!
Stop!
We found the transceiver, but it's not working.
Can anybody help?
Yes
I might be able to.
Oh, great! Perfect.
Let's trust this guy.
Hey, we're all in this together.
Treat each other with respect...
Shut up, lardo.
Give it a break.
Whatever you say, doc,
You're the hero.
You guys found the cockpit?
Any survivors?
No.
Dual-band. Military spec.
Chances are the battery is good,
but the radio is dead.
Can you fix it?
I need some time.
Doctor, that man with the shrapnel,
I think you should take a look at him.
Chain-smoking jackass.
Some people have problems.
Some people have problems. Us.
Him.
You're okay.
I like you.
You're okay too.
How do you know how to do that?
I was a communications officer.
Oh, yeah?
You ever see battle?
I fought in the Gulf War.
No way. I got a buddy who fought over there.
He was in the 104th Airborne.
What were you, Air Force? Army?
The Republican Guard.
Is it working?
It seems to be,
except we're not picking up a signal.
Why do we need to pick up a signal?
Aren't we trying to send one?
Yes, but what you want to see here is little bars.
The bars show it's getting reception.
We need the bars?
We could broadcast blind,
hope that someone, maybe a ship somewhere picks up our distress call.
But that would be a waste of the battery,
which might not last for long
There is one thing we could try.
What?
Get the signal from high ground.
How high?
How is he?
Can you do anything?
I can pull out the shrapnel.
But you said if you took it out...
That was yesterday.
I was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now.
If I leave him like this he'll be dead within a day.
If I open him up...If I can control the bleeding,
and if he doesn't go into sepsis,
and if I can find some antibiotics,
he might be all right.
I'm going on a hike.
Sorry?
SSayid fixed the transceiver, but we can't use it.
Not from here.
Kate, wait a minute.
You said we had to send a signal.
Look, you saw what that thing did to that pilot.
Yeah, I did.
What makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle?
Wait for me. I don't know how long...
Sayid said the battery won't last.
All right.
If you see or hear anything...
Anything...
Run.
What's up?
What, that?
What, eat that?
Dude, dude,
I'm starving.
But I am nowhere near that hungry.
No. No. No, thank you.
No way. No.
The comic's in Spanish. You...
...read Spanish?
No.
I found it.
Tell you what, we get home...
...l'll get you another dog.
I need your help.
Okay.
Help me go through the luggage.
I need any prescription medications you find,
especially drugs that end in "mycin" and "cillin."
Those are antibiotics.
What's this for?
What are you doing?
I think I was mean to him.
What?
He's that guy from the gate.
He wouldn't let us have our seats in first class.
He saved our lives.
Shannon, we're trying to clear the wreckage.
You should help out.
You're just being worthless over here.
I'm being what?
What do you want me to say?
You're sitting on your ass staring at bodies.
I've just been through a trauma here, okay?
We've all been through a trauma.
The only difference is, since the crash,
you've actually given yourself a pedicure.
You know what? It is so easy to make fun of me, and you're good at it.
I wish I didn't have to waste ly time...
I wish I didn't have a reason. Yeah, it is easy, Shannon.
Screw you. You do not have the slightest idea what I am thinking.
I have a much better idea than you think I do.
No, you don't!
Okay, Shannon, what are you thinking?
I'm going with them on the hike.
Oh, yeah?
Yup. I'm going.
No you're not, Shannon.
I'd like to come with you.
She's not going.
This is what she does.
The hell I'm not!
She postures and makes really bad decisions to upset her family
which, at the moment, is me.
Shut up and stop trying to be charming.
I'm coming with you.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
What are you, two years older than me? Please?
You're going, aren't you?
Yeah. Are you?
Yup.
Yeah, I'm definitely going.
Look, everybody can come. But we're leaving now.
You couldn't tell from that, but she's really nice.
You decided to join us.
I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.
What are you looking for?
Some sort of blade.
How's your son?
Walt? Yeah, I think he'll be all right.
How old is he?
Nine. Ten.
Ten.
Walt's more worried about his dog than anything.
The dog was on the plane, so...
Kids, you know.
Is it a lab?
Yeah.
Yeah?
I saw him yesterday in the jungle.
What?
Where?
Over there...
A couple hundred yards in or so.
He looked good.
What is it, like checkers?
Not really. It's a better game than checkers.
Do you play checkers with your pop?
No.
I live in Australia with my mom.
You have no accent.
Yeah, I know, we move a lot.
She got sick.
She died a couple of weeks ago.
You're having a bad month.
I guess.
Backgammon is the oldest game in the world.
Archaeologists found sets when they excavated the ruins
of ancient Mesopotamia.
Five thousand years old.
That's older than Jesus Christ.
Did they have dice and stuff?
But theirs weren't made of plastic.
Their dice were made of bones.
Cool.
Two players. Two sides.
One is light. One is dark.
...do you wanna know a secret?
No, thank you.
No, that's fine.
Okay. Thanks.
Oh, God.
I just felt it!
I just... Come here, feel this!
Do you feel that?
That, right there.That's a kick!
There, right there's a foot!
Oh, my God, wait,he's moving around.
He. He.
I guess I think you're a he.
Okay. Wide open space.
Check the radio, see if we're good.
We're not gonna have reception.
Just try it.
I don't want to waste batteries.
I'm not asking to keep it on.
We're blocked by the mountain.
Check the damn radio!
We might not have any juice left when we get to...
Oh, my God.
What the hell's that?
Something's coming.
Coming towards us.
Come on, let's move.
I shouldn't have come on this hike!
Let him go!
That's...
That's a big bear.
You think that's what killed the pilot?
No.
No, that's a tiny, teeny version compared to that.
Guys, this isn't just a bear.
It's a polar bear.
You sure he's out?
He's out.
How do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out?
I don't.
Hey, guy, you awake?
Yo! There's a rescue plane! We're saved! Yay!
Yeah, he's out.
So, what do you want me...?
It's unlikely he'll regain consciousness,
but the pain might bring him around.
If it does, hold him down.
Uh... I'm not so good around blood, man.
Then don't look.
Yeah. But...
I'm not so good around blood.
Just do the best you can, okay?
Don't look.
Okay.
Dude.
Hand me those strips.
Dude.
Just hand me the strips. I need to get this bleeding stopped.
I don't think I can.
What? What's going on?
Just hand me the strips.
Give it to me.
Don't even think about it.
Don't even think it. Hurley, hey!
Damn it.
That can't be a polar bear.
It's a polar bear.
Wait a minute.
Polar bears don't live in the jungle.
Spot-on.
No. Polar bears don't live this far south.
This one does.
Did. It did.
Where did that come from?
Probably Bear Village. How the hell do I know?
Not the bear, the gun.
I got it off one of the bodies.
One of the bodies?
Yeah, one of the bodies.
People don't carry guns on planes.
They do if they're a U.S. Marshal, sweet cheeks.
There was one on the plane.
How do you know that?
I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster,
so I took the gun,
thought it might come in handy.
Guess what,
I just shot a bear.
So why do you think he's a marshal?
Because he had a clip-on badge!
I took that too. Thought it was cool.
I know who you are.
You're the prisoner.
I'm the what?
You found a gun on a U.S. marshal?
Yes, I think you did.
You knew where it was because he was bringing you back to the States.
The handcuffs were on you.
That's how you knew.
Piss off!
That's who you are, you son of a bitch.
Be as suspicious of me as I am of you.
You are the prisoner.
Fine, I'm the criminal.
You're the terrorist.
We'll all play a part!
Who do you wanna be?
Does anybody know how to use a gun?
I think you just pull the trigger.
Don't use the gun.
I want to take it apart.
There's a button on the grip.
Push that, it will eject the magazine.
There's still a round in the chamber.
Hold the grip, pull the top part of the gun.
I know your type.
I'm not so sure.
Yeah, I've been with girls like you.
Not girls exactly like me.
Can I get you a refill?
I'm fine with this, thank you.
You, sir, can I get you anything?
Cocktail, soda?
Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.
Coffee, sure.
You look worried.
I'd be worried too, I was you.
But you gotta stay positive, kiddo.
There's always that off-chance that they'll believe your story.
I know I sure do.
I don't care what you believe.
Oh, I know that's true.
That has always been true.
You sure you don't want some more juice?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Ladies and gentleman,
the captain has switched on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.
Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
I have one favor to ask.
Really?
This oughta be good.
We should keep moving.
No.
Where is she?
Who?
Oh, now's a good time to check the radio.
Not before, but now.
We're up higher.
Yes, we are.
Bar. Hey, we've got a bar!
Mayday, Mayday!
What is that?
Feedback.
From what? What would do that?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what.
This guy not fixing the radio.
The thing doesn't even work.
No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken.
We can't transmit because something else is already transmitting.
Transmitting from where?
What?
Somewhere close. The signal's strong.
Somewhere close?
On the island? That's great!
Maybe it's other survivors.
From our plane? How would they...
What kind of transmission is it?
It could be a sat phone, maybe a radio signal.
Can we listen to it?
Let me get the frequency first. Hold on.
There's no transmission.
Shut up!
The rescue party, it has to be.
French. The French are coming!
I've never been so happy to hear the French.
I never took French. What is she saying?
Does anyone speak French?
She does.
No, I don't. What?
What the hell are you talking about? You spent a year in Paris!
Drinking! Not studying!
Okay, what's that?
Oh, no, no, no.
What?
Batteries are dying.
How much time do we have?
Not much.
I've heard you speak french. Just listen to this.
Listen.
I can't!
Do you speak French, because that would be nice.
That voice is weird. What is that?
Come on, come on.
It's... It's repeating.
She's right.
What?
It's a loop. "lteration."
It's repeating the same message.
It's a counter. Iteration...
The next number will end 5-3-3.
Does anyone know what he's talking about?
It's a running count of the number of times the message has repeated.
It's roughly 30 seconds long, so...
How long...?
Don't forget to carry the one, chief.
She's saying...
Please.
She's saying, "Please, help me."
Please, come get me.
Or she's not! You don't even speak French!
Let her!
Shut up! Man
Guys, the battery. The battery.
I'm alone now.
I'm... on the island alone.
Please, someone come.
The others, they're...
They're dead.
It killed them.
It killed them all.
That was good.
Sixteen years.
What?
Sixteen years...
and 5 months. That's the count.
What the hell are you talking about?
The iterations.
It's a distress call.
A plea for help. A Mayday.
If the counter's right...
...it's been playing over and over......for 16 years.
Someone else was stranded here?
Maybe they came for them.
If someone came, why is it still playing?
Guys...
where are we?
Do you think he's gonna live?
Do you know him?
He was sitting next to me.
You'd think they would have come by now.
-Who? -Anyone.
What is it, like checkers?
Not really. It's a better game than checkers.
Two players, two sides.
One is light, one is dark.
Walt...
Do you want to know a secret?
Don't trust her.
She's dangerous.
Try not to move, man.
I have to find her.
I have to bring her back.
Yeah, you keep saying that.
And every time I ask you who you have to bring back,
you pass out on me again.
Since your fever's running pretty high,
I'm guessing you have no idea who the hell you're talking about.
My cuffs.
My handcuffs.
Where are my cuffs?
What?
My jacket pocket.
-I don't...-My jacket pocket.
Okay.
Dangerous.
She's dangerous.
It's getting dark.
Then pick up the pace.
-Hick.  -A little louder?
We should make camp.
-What, here? -Yes, here.
I'm not stopping. Y'all have a nice cookout.
Excellent. Walk through the jungle in the dark.
Ooh, afraid the trees are gonna get us?
No. What is knocking down the trees will get you.
Well, you're so worried about me,
how about you give me the clip back?
Put your gun back in your pants, Sawyer.
Sayid's right. You keep walking, you're not gonna make it to the beach.
Yeah, why's that?
why's that?
This is Australia.
This is us.
Nice stick.
Two da ago, we take off from Sydney.
We fly along the same northeast route
every commercial airliner bound for los angeles does.
Now, the pilot, he said he lost communication with the ground, correct?
Yeah, six hours in.
He turned around and headed for Fiji.
So he changed course.
Regrettably, no one knew he changed course.
The turbulence hit.
We know the rest.
The pilot said we were over 1,000 miles off course.
Yeah, but they'll find us.
They have satellites in space that can take pictures of your license plate.
If only we were all wearing license plates.
Well, aren't you the pessimist.
Basic photography...point and shoot.
Satellites can shoot,but they must be told where to point.
Bollocks.
Okay, really enjoyed the puppet show. Fantastic.
So we're stuck in the middle of damn nowhere.
How about we talk about that other thing?
You know, the transmission Abdul picked up on his little radio.
The French chick that said "they're all dead."
The transmission's been on a loop for...how long was it, freckles?
-16 years. -Right.
Let's talk about that.
Well, we have to tell the others when we get back.
-Tell them what exactly?  -What we heard.
You didn't hear anything. I'm not a stupid translator.
No one's going to tell them anything.
To relay what we heard
without fully understanding it will cause a panic.
If we tell them what we know,
we take away their hope.
And hope is a very dangerous thing to lose.
So we lie.
-It wasn't a dinosaur.No-
You said you didn't see it.
I didn't.
So how do you know it wasn't a dinosaur?
Because dinosaurs are extinct.
Yeah.
So what's his story?
He looks kind of...
dying.
-He's not gonna die.  -He's yellow, man.
His wound is infected, but the antibiotics will fight it off.
hat if they don't?
Then his body will shut down
one piece at a time.
His abdomen goes rigid, then...
He looks like he's in pain.
Yeah.
What's this?
Dude?
What do you think she did?
It's none of my business.
-She looks pretty hardcore.  -Hurley.
What are you doing?
I'm standing guard.
You heard what they said's out there.
You took my gun off me, boy?
You've never even held a gun. He doesn't believe in guns.
-He goes on marches.  -I don't go on marches.
Give it back to me.
Yeah, give it to Al-jazeera. He'll protect us.
Al-jazeera's a network.
-I'll keep the damn gun.  -We should give it to her.
Yeah.
Kate should hold the gun.
Fine with me.
Well?
-Good morning.  -Morning.
You're sleeping in my sheep pen.
Sorry.
How'd you get here?
-I walked.  -You walked?
-Yeah.  -From where?
-Town.  -Nearest town's 15 kilometers.
Maybe that's why I'm so exhausted.
What's your name?
You hungry, Annie?
So, you want to tell me why you're trespassing on my property?
I ran out of money.
You're an American?
Canadian.
I graduated from college and figured I'd see the world.
Australia was top of my list,so I hopped a flight to Melbourne,
but I don't know anybody here,
so I just figured I'd walk for a while,you know?
Melbourne's a hundred kilometers from here.
I like walking.
And you just happened to wander onto my farm?
I like farms, too.
Do you know how to work one?
Yeah.
My wife died eight months ago wednesday.
She left me with too many chores and a hell of a mortgage.
If you help me with the first one,
I'll give you a fair wage and a place to stay.
Deal.
I'm a lefty.
Dude ! Dude !
They're back.
As you and the others know,
we hiked up the mountain in an attempt to help the rescue team locate us.
The transceiver failed to pick up a signal.
We weren't able to send out a call for help.
But we're not giving up.
If we gather electronic equipment
your cell phones, laptops...
I can boost the signal and we can try again.
But that may take some time, so for now,
we should begin rationing our remaining food.
If it rains, we should set up tarps to collect water.
I need to organize three separate groups.
Each group should have a leader.
One group for water. I'll organize that.
Who's going to organize electronics?
You...rationing food?
Okay.
And I will need a third group to concern themselves with the construction of...
I, um... I need to tell you something.
Okay. Sure.
We couldn't send out a signal because
there was another signal blocking it.
The other signal...
we heard it.
It was a distress call from a French woman.
She said that the others were dead.
That something had killed them all.
She was alone on the island.
It's been playing for 16 years, Jack.
I wanted to tell you.
Anything else?
How is he?
The man with the shrapnel in his side.
He's touch and go.
Did he wake up?
Nah, just for a few seconds during the surgery.
He say anything?
No.
So what'd she say?
She didn't say anything.
But you told her you knew.
I don't know anything.
Well, you kinda know she's in that mug shot.
And that we found those handcuffs.
And that guy keeps mumbling "she's dangerous,she's dangerous" over and over.
It's not my business. Not my problem.
Yeah, you're right.
We'll let Johnny Fever take care of her when he gets better.
He's not getting better if we don't get some stronger antibiotics.
-That stuff I got from the luggage... -It's for ear infections and foot fungus.
I went through everything, man.
What about that luggage in the overhead compartments?
-That's inside the plane.  -Yeah?
But the bodies are in there,and they're all...
dead.
Look, I'll handle it.Why don't you keep an eye on...
Great. Yeah, I'd love to. On it.
What are you doing in here?
Trick-or-treatin', same as you.
You're looting.
Ahh! You say potato.
What's in the bag?
Booze, smokes, a couple "playboys."
-What's in yours?  -Medicine.
Well, just about sums it up, don't it?
You do this back home, too?
Steal from the dead?
Brother, you got to wake up and smell the gull crap here.
Rescue ain't coming.
You're just wasting your time,
trying to save a guy who,last time I checked,
had a piece of metal the size of my head sticking out of his bread basket.
Let me ask you something.
How many of those pills are you going to use to fix him up?
-As many as it takes.  -Yeah?
How many you got?
You're just not looking at the big picture, doc.
You're still back in civilization.
-Yeah? And where are you?  -Me?
I'm in the wild.
I got it.
I got it.
Thanks.
I got it. I got it. Yeah.
Well, look on the bright side.
Whoever's this was is probably better off than we are.
I got it.
-How's the baby?  -It's okay, I think.
Good.
So, your,
your husband, was he on the flight?
no, I'm not married.
I know. How modern of me.
Well, who needs men, right?
Bloody useless.
So, you guys hiked all the way up on that mountain for nothing, huh?
Sorry.
I was gonna get some more water.
We haven't met. I'm Kate.
-Hi, Kate.  -Hi.
I was just looking for Jack,and I thought he might be in there.
Yeah...no.
He went to go get some medicine.
Over there.
-Where, in the fuselage?-What?
Yeah. Yeah, in the,
You know, I got to go get that water.
The bank would have given you a heck of a toaster
if you'd kept that in a savings account.
What do I need a toaster for?
You're hiding your wages in a tin can, Annie.
I mean, I would have held onto it for you.
I got trust issues.
Weren't you gonna say goodbye?
I wrote you a note.
You've been here for almost three months, Annie,
and every time I ask you about yourself,
you get that look in your eye.
Yeah, that one.
So I mind my own business.
I figured maybe you got off on the wrong side of a bad relationship.
Maybe you ran.
I always knew you'd leave here someday.
I guess I hoped it wouldn't be in the middle of the night.
-I'm sorry.  -Yeah.
So am I.
Annie, why don't you just stay one more night, eh?
I'll drive you to the train station first thing in the morning.
I promise.
Okay.
Good.
I get it, you know.
Everyone deserves a fresh start.
Damn it!
Let her go, damn it!
Breathe! Come on!
Come on, come on.
Look at me! Look...
What did you do?
I was just checking to see if he was...
He jumped on me.
He grabbed me.
Is he... okay?
He's not responding to any antibiotics,
he's bleeding internally,his fever's pushing 104,
and his abdomen's rigid.
He needs water.
So what are you going to do about it?
-About what?  -About him.
I told you, he needs water.
Will he suffer?
What?!
Will it be quick?
No, it won't be quick.
Two, three, maybe four days.
And he'll feel it?
Yeah, he'll feel it.
Can't you put him out of his misery?
I saw your mug shot, Kate.
I am not a murder.
Don't listen to Patsy Cline in Canada?
They listen to Patsy Cline everywhere.
You hungry?
-I'll eat on the train.  -You sure?
A little place up here makes a mean burger.
I'm not. Just...
How long have you known?
Couple of days.
I saw your picture in the post office.
I guess they knew you were down under.
Why?
The reward's $23,000.
I told you when I met you. I got a hell of a mortgage.
If it makes you feel any better,
it was a hard decision, Annie.
My name's not Annie.
who's that guy you were hanging out with?
What guy?
You know, the bald guy.
-Oh, mr. Locke?  -Mr. Locke.
-Mr. Locke got any kids?  -He didn't say.
-Yeah, what did he say?  -I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know? What did he say?
-Some of it's secret.  -He tell you not to tell me?
-No.  -Then what's the secret?
Mr. Locke said a miracle happened here.
Yeah, well, a miracle happened to all of us, Walt.
We survived the plane crash.
Look, I don't want you hanging around him anymore.
Why not? He's my friend.
Hey, I'm your friend, too.
If you're my friend, you'd find Vincent.
Look, I haven't given up on your dog.
I'm gonna do everything I can to find him.
-No, you won't.-Yeah, Walt, I will.
You don't care about Vincent.
I'm gonna get your dog back as soon as it stops raining.
Okay, listen to me.I'm gonna get your dog back.
"As soon as it stops raining."
Good. Nice.
I'm gonna find your dog.
Yeah, I'm just gonna go walking through the haunted damn jungle
looking for your...
Vincent? That you, buddy?
Something was,  chasing me, so,
Yeah, I don't hear it now.
but you should probably
head... back.
I didn't see anything.
You know, if you're worried about it,
I...I didn't see anything.
-What are you making?  -A whistle.
I used some tribal flutes once in a recording session.
I'm in a band.
I wish he would just die already.
Real humane, Shannon.
Anything I can do to help?
No, I'm good. Thanks.
The others are getting upset.
They want to know what's going on inside the tent.
I'm trying to save his life.
Rumor has it you can't.
You need a light?
Came by to thank you.
-You gonna ask what for?  -What for?
For taking that gun away from me.
-I didn't take it away from you.  -Stickin' out of your denims, ain't it?
Sure wouldn't want to be the one with that gun right now.
'Cause everyone sitting out there listening that poor boy scream all night
knows what's got to be done.
Only one that can do it is the one with that gun.
Don't act so surprised.
I heard you tell hero the same thing.
Hell, there's only one bullet left.
Be damn near poetic.
-Listen to me...  -No, you need to keep quiet.
Listen to me.
No matter what she does,no matter how she makes you feel,
just don't...
trust a word that she says.
She will do anything to get away.
What did she do?
-I want to talk to her.  -Tell me what she did.
I want to talk to her alone.
She got to you, too, huh?
What was it?
-What?  -The favor.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Last thing I heard before the crash,you wanted a favor.
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has switched on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.
Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
-I have one favor to ask.  -Really?
This ought to be good.
Well?
I wanted you to make sure that Ray Mullen got his 23 grand.
What, the guy who ratted you out?
He had a hell of a mortgage.
You really are one of a kind.
You know, you would have got away if hadn't saved him.
In case you hadn't noticed, I did get away.
You don't look free to me.
Kate, I'm gonna die, right?
Yeah.
So...are you gonna do it,
or what?
So, where's the fugitive?
In the tent.
You let her in there alone?
What's she gonna do?
-She's 120 pounds soaking wet.  -Yeah, but she's got that gun.
-What?  -She's strapped, man.
I saw it in her...in her...in her
-What did you do?  -What you couldn't.
Look, I get where you're coming from,being a doctor and all.
But he wanted it. Hell, he asked me.
So I don't like it any more than you do,
but something had to be done.
no way.
Guys.
You shot him in the chest?
I was aiming for his heart.
You missed.
Is he still breathing ?
You perforated his lung.It'll take hours to bleed out.
There was...only had one bullet.
Get out. Get out!
Damn it!
I found your son's dog.
What?
I tethered him to a tree just over there.
I know that Walt lost his mom.
I thought that you should be one
Thanks
You're welcome.
I want to tell you what I did.
Why he was after me.
I don't wanna know.
It doesn't matter, Kate,
who we were,
what we did before this,
before the crash
it doesn't really...
Three days ago, we all died
We should all be able to start over.
Okay.
Okay?
Edmund! Get away from there!
Peter! What do you think you're doing?
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!
- Come on!      - Wait...
Come on, leave it!
Mommy!
Lucy, come on!
- Come on, quickly!     - Run!
Run!
- Hurry!     - Mum!
- Wait! Dad!     - Ed!
- Edmund, no!      - I'll get him!
- Peter, come back!     - Ed! Come here!
Edmund! Get down!
Come on, you idiot, run!
Get out!
Come on!
Hurry!
Why can't you think of anyone but yourself? You're so selfish!
You could've got us killed!
It's OK. Shh.
Why can't you just do as you're told?
Alms for the poor.
God bless you, sir.
Children and evacuation staff...
You need to keep this on, darling. All right?
You warm enough? Good girl.
Say hello to Auntie Laura. Goodbye, darling, we love you.
If Dad were here, he wouldn't make us go.
If Dad were here, it'd mean the war was over and we wouldn't have to.
You will listen to your brother, won't you, Edmund?
Promise me you'll look after the others.
I will, Mum.
- Good man.      - All aboard! All aboard!
- Bye, darling!       - Bye!
Susan.
Be a big girl.
Hold on to your brother's hand. Don't let it go.
All right. Off you go.
- All aboard!      - Bye-bye. Love you.
Hey, get off. I know how to get on a train by myself.
Get off me!
May I have your tickets, please? Tickets, please.
Peter.
- That's right. On you go.     - Yes. Thank you.
Come along. Come along this way, please.
Come on, Lucy. We have to stick together now.
Everything's gonna be all right. It's gonna be fine.
Bye, Mommy! I love you!
- Bye-bye, dear.     - Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.
- I love you, Mum! Bye!      - See you soon!
- Write to us, Mum!      - Love you!
Goosey Station. Goosey Station.
Give me your hand. Let's get going.
The professor knew we were coming.
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled.
Come on, hup!
And whoa. Whoa.
- Mrs. Macready?      - I'm afraid so.
Is this it, then? Haven't you brought anything else?
No, ma'am.
It's just us.
Small favors.
Come on. Good girl. Come on. Come on.
Professor Kirke is not accustomed to havin' children in this house.
And, as such, there are a few rules we need to follow.
There will no shoutin Or runnin
No improper use of the dumbwaiter.
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!
And above all,

German aircraft carried out a number of attacks
on Great Britain last night.
The raids, Which lasted for several hours...
The sheets feel scratchy.
Wars don't last forever, Lucy. We'll be home soon.
- Yeah, if home's still there.      - lsn't it time you were in bed?
- Yes, Mum.       - Ed!
You saw outside. This place is huge.
We can do whatever we want here.
Tomorrow's going to be great.
Really.
- Is it Latin?      - Yes.
Is it Latin for "worst game ever invented"?
We could play hide and seek.
But we're already having so much fun.
Come on, Peter, please.
Pretty please?
- One, two, three, four...      - What?
...five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, 11...
I was here first!
Were you hiding from me?
No.
Uh, well...
I just... I...
No. No. I-l-I just...
I was just, um... I didn't want to scare you.
If you don't mind my asking... what are you?
Well, I'm a... Well, I'm a faun.
And what about you?
You must be some kind of beardless dwarf?
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.
You mean to say that you're a Daughter of Eve?
Well, my mum's name is Helen.
Yes, but you are in fact human.
Yes, of course.
What are you doing here?
Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe in the spare room, and...
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?
Narnia? What's that?
Well, dear girl, you're in it.
Everything from the lamppost
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel on the Eastern Ocean,
every stick and stone you see,
every icicle is Narnia.
This is an awfully big wardrobe.
War Drobe? I'm sorry.
Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tumnus.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus. I'm Lucy Pevensie.
- Oh, you shake it.     - Uh... Why?
I... I don't know.
People do it when they meet each other.
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie from the shining city of War Drobe
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,
how would it be if you came and had tea with me?
Well, thank you very much, but l...
I probably should be getting back.
It's only just around the corner. And there'll be a glorious fire
with toast and tea and cakes.
And, perhaps, we'll even break into the sardines.
- I don't know.      - Come on.
It's not every day that I get to make a new friend.
Well, I suppose I could come for a little while.
If you have sardines.
By the bucketload.
- You all right?      - Mm-hm.
Well, here we are.
Come along.
- After you.      - May I help you with that?
Thank you very much.
Now, that... that is my father.
He has a nice face.
He looks a lot like you.
No.
No, I'm not very much like him at all, really.
My father's fighting in the war.
My father went away to war too.
But that was a long, long time ago.
- Before this dreadful winter.      - Winter's not all bad.
There's ice skating and snowball fights.
- Oh! And Christmas!       - Not here.
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas in a hundred years.
What? No presents for a hundred years?
Always winter, never Christmas.
It's been a long winter.
But you would have loved Narnia in summer.
We fauns danced with the dryads all night,
and, you know, we never got tired.
And music. Oh, such music!
Would... would you like to hear some now?
Oh! Yes, please.
Now, are you familiar
- with any Narnian lullabies?      - Sorry, no.
Well, that's good.
Because this... probably won't sound anything like one.
- Oh, I should go.      - It's too late for that now.
I'm such a terrible faun.
Oh, no.
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.
Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor sampling.
No. You can't have done anything that bad.
It's not something I have done, Lucy Pevensie.
It's something I am doing.
What are you doing?
I'm kidnapping you.
It was the White Witch.
She's the one who makes it always winter, always cold.
She gave orders.
If any of us ever find a human wandering in the woods,
we're supposed to turn it over to her.
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.
I thought you were my friend.
Now. She may already know you're here.
The woods are full of her spies.
Even some of the trees are on her side.
Can you find your way back from here?
- I think so.      - All right.
Will you be all right?
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Here.
Keep it. You need it more than I do.
No matter what happens, Lucy Pevensie,
I am glad to have met you.
You've made me feel warmer than I've felt in a hundred years.
Now go.
Go!
Ready or not, here I come!
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!
Shut up! He's coming!
You know, I'm not sure you two have quite got the idea of this game.
Weren't you wondering where I was?
That's the point. That was why he was seeking you.
Does this mean I win?
I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore.
I've been gone for hours.
Lucy, the only wood in here is the back of the wardrobe.
One game at a time, Lu. We don't all have your imagination.
But I wasn't imagining!
That's enough, Lucy.
I wouldn't lie about this!
Well, I believe you.
- You do?      - Yeah, of course.
Didn't I tell you about the field in the cupboards?
Will you just stop?
You just have to make everything worse, don't you?
- It was just a joke!      - When are you gonna learn to grow up?
Shut up! You think you're Dad, but you're not!
Well, that was nicely handled.
But... it really was there.
Susan's right, Lucy.
That's enough.
Lucy.
Where are you?
Boo!
Lucy.
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.
Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy!
Lucy.
Where are you?
Lucy.
I think I believe you now.
Lucy.
Lucy?
- Leave me alone!       - What is it now, Ginarrbrik?
Make him let me go! I didn't do anything wrong!
How dare you address the Queen of Narnia?
I didn't know!
- You will know her better hereafter!       - Wait!
What is your name, Son of Adam?
Uh, Edmund.
And how, Edmund, did you come to enter my dominion?
I'm not sure. I was just following my sister.
- Your sister? How many are you?       - Four.
Lucy's the only one that's been here before.
She said she met some faun called Tumnus.
Peter and Susan didn't believe her. I didn't either.
Edmund, you look so cold. Will you come and sit with me?
Now, how about something hot to drink?
Yes, please, Your Majesty.
Your drink, sire.
How did you do that?
I can make anything you like.
Can you make me taller?
Anything you'd like to eat.
Turkish delight?
Edmund?
I would very much like to meet the rest of your family.
Why?
They're nothing special.
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly as delightful as you are.
But you see, Edmund, I have no children of my own.
And you are exactly the sort of boy
who I could see, one day, becoming Prince of Narnia.
Maybe even King.
Really?
Of course, you'd have to bring your family.
Oh.
Do you mean, Peter would be king too?
No! No, no.
But a king needs servants.
I guess I could bring 'em.
Beyond these woods, you see those two hills?
My house is right between them.
You'd love it there, Edmund.
It has whole rooms simply stuffed with Turkish delight.
- Couldn't I have some more now?       - No!
Don't want to ruin your appetite.
Besides, you and I are going to be seeing each other again very soon.
I hope so, Your Majesty.
Until then, dear one. Mmm, I'm gonna miss you.
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Edmund?
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!
Isn't it wonderful?
- Where have you been?        - With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.
The White Witch hasn't found out anything about him meeting me.
The White Witch?
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, but she really isn't.
Are you all right? You look awful.
Well, what'd you expect? I mean, it's freezing.
- How do we get out of here?       - Come on.
This way.
Peter, Peter, wake up! Peter, wake up!
- It's there! It's really there!       - Shh.
- Lucy, what are you talking about?      - Narnia!
It's all in the wardrobe like I told you!
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.       - But I haven't!
I saw Mr. Tumnus again! And this time Edmund went too.
You... You saw the faun?
Well, he didn't actually go there with me.
He...
What were you doing, Edmund?
I was just playing along.
I'm sorry, Peter.
I shouldn't have encouraged her,
but you know what little children are like these days.
They just don't know when to stop pretending.
Ow!
You children are one shenanigan shy of sleepin' in the stable!
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them you were not to be disturbed.
It's all right, Mrs. Macready. I'm sure there's an explanation.
But first of all, I think this one is in need of a little hot chocolate.
Come along, dear.
You seem to have upset the delicate internal balance of my housekeeper.
We're very sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.
- The weeping girl.        - Yes, sir.
- She's upset.      - Hence the weeping.
It's nothing.
- We can handle it.        - Oh, I can see that.
She thinks she's found a magical land. In the upstairs wardrobe.
What did you say?
Um, the wardrobe, upstairs.
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.
She won't stop going on about it.
- What was it like?       - Like talking to a lunatic.
No, no, no, not her. The forest.
- You're not saying you believe her?       - You don't?
But of course not.
I mean, logically, it's impossible.
What do they teach in schools these days?
Edmund said they were only pretending.
He's usually the more truthful one, is he?
No. This would be the first time.
Well, if she's not mad and she's not lying,
then logically we must assume she's telling the truth.
You're saying that we should just believe her?
She's your sister, isn't she? You're her family.
You might just try acting like one.
Peter winds up, poised to take yet another wicket!
Ow!
Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream.
Why can't we play hide and seek again?
I thought you said it was a kid's game.
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.
It's not like there isn't air inside.
- Are you ready?      - Are you?
- Well done, Ed.       - You bowled it!
- What on earth is goin' on?       - The Macready!
Come on!
No, no, back, back, back!
- Come on!       - Oh, you've got to be joking.
Get back!
- My toe!       - I'm not on your toe!
- Move back.        - Will you stop shoving?
lmpossible.
Don't worry.
I'm sure it's just your imagination.
I don't suppose saying we're sorry
- would quite cover it.     - No. It wouldn't.
But that might!
Ow!
Stop it!
You little liar.
- You didn't believe her, either.      - Apologize to Lucy.
- Say you're sorry. - All right! I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Some children just don't know when to stop pretending.
Oh, very funny.
Maybe we should go back.
But shouldn't we at least take a look around?
I think Lucy should decide.
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.
But we can't go hiking in the snow dressed like this.
No.
But I'm sure the professor wouldn't mind us using these.
Anyway, if you think about it logically,
we're not even taking them out of the wardrobe.
- But that's a girl's coat! - I know.
...Iots and lots of lovely food, and we'll have lots and lots of...
Lu?
Lucy!
Who would do something like this?
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged
with High Treason against Her lmperial Majesty,
Jadis, Queen of Narnia,
for comforting her enemies and fraternizing with humans.
Signed Maugrim, Captain of the Secret Police.
Long Live the Queen."
All right. Now we really should go back.
But what about Mr. Tumnus?
If he was arrested just for being with a human,
- I don't think there's much we can do.      - You don't understand, do you?
I'm the human.
She must have found out he helped me.
- Maybe we could call the police.      - These are the police.
Don't worry, Lu. We'll think of something.
Why?
I mean, he's a criminal.
Psst.
Did that bird just "psst" us?
It... It's a beaver.
Here, boy.
Here, boy.
I ain't gonna smell it, if that's what you want.
Oh.
Sorry.
Lucy Pevensie?
Yes?
Hey, that's the hankie I gave to Mr. Tum...
Tumnus. He got it to me just before they took him.
Is he all right?
Further in.
- What are you doing?      - She's right.
How do we know we can trust him?
He said he knows the faun.
He's a beaver. He shouldn't be saying anything!
Everything all right?
Yes. We were just talking.
That's better left for safer quarters.
He means the trees.
Come on. We don't want to be caught out here after nightfall.
Ah, blimey! Looks like the old girl has got the kettle on.
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.
- It's lovely.      - It's merely a trifle.
Still plenty to do. Ain't quite finished it yet.
It'll look the business when it is, though.
Beaver, is that you? I've been worried sick!
If I find you've been out with Badger again, l...
Oh!
Well, those aren't badgers.
Oh, I never thought I'd live to see this day.
Look at my fur. You couldn't give me ten minutes warning?
I'd have given a week if I thought it would've helped.
Oh, come inside,
and we'll see if we can't get you some food,
and some civilized company.
Now, careful. Watch your step.
Excuse the mess.
Can't get Mr. Beaver to get out of his chair.
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?
Isn't there anything we can do to help Tumnus?
They'll have taken him to the Witch's. You know what they say.
There's few that go through them gates that come out again.
Fish 'n' chips?
But there is hope, dear. Lots of hope.
Oh, yeah, there's a right bit more than hope!
Aslan is on the move.
Who's Aslan?
Who's Aslan?
You cheeky little blighter.
What?
- You don't know, do you?      - We haven't exactly been here long.
Well, he's only the king of the whole wood.
The top geezer. The real King of Narnia.
- He's been away for a long while.      - But he's just got back!
And he's waitin' for you near the Stone Table!
- He's waiting for us?      - You're bloomin' joking!
They don't even know about the prophecy!
- Well, then...      - Look.
Aslan's return,
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,
it's all happening because of you!
- You're blaming us?      - No! Not blaming.
- Thanking you. - There's a prophecy.
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,
the evil time will be over and done."
- That doesn't really rhyme.      - I know it don't.
You're kinda missin' the point!
It has long been foretold
that two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve
will defeat the White Witch and restore peace to Narnia.
And you think we're the ones?
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's already fitted out your army.
- Our army?      - Mum sent us away
so we wouldn't get caught up in a war.
I think you've made a mistake.
- We're not heroes.      - We're from Finchley.
Thank you for your hospitality.
- But we really have to go. - No, you can't just leave!
He's right. We have to help Mr. Tumnus.
It's out of our hands.
I'm sorry,
but it's time the four of us were getting home. Ed?
Ed?
- I'm gonna kill him.      - You may not have to.
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?
Hurry!
- Edmund!      - Shh! They'll hear you!
No!
- Get off!      - You're playing into her hands.
- We can't just let him go!       - He's our brother!
He's the bait! The Witch wants all four of you!
- Why?      - To stop the prophecy from coming true.
To kill you!
- This is all your fault.      - My fault?
None of this would have happened if you had listened to me!
- You knew this would happen.      - I didn't know.
Which is why we should have left while we could!
Stop it!
- This isn't going to help Edmund.      - She's right.
Only Aslan can help your brother now.
Then take us to him.
Be still, stranger, or you'll never move again.
- Who are you?      - I'm Edmund!
I met the Queen in the woods! She told me to come back here!
I'm a Son of Adam!
Hmm. My apologies, fortunate favorite of the queen.
Or else, not so fortunate.
Right this way.
Wait here.
Like it?
Uh... Yes, Your Majesty.
I thought you might.
Tell me, Edmund...
Are your sisters deaf?
No.
And your brother, is he...
...unintelligent?
WeII, I think so. But Mum says...
Then how dare you come aIone?!
- I tried!      - Edmund, I asked so IittIe of you.
- They just don't Iisten to me!      - You couIdn't even do that.
I did bring them haIfway.
They're at the IittIe house at the dam with the Beavers.
WeII.
I suppose you're not a totaI Ioss then, are you?
WeII, I was wondering,
couId I maybe have some more Turkish deIight now?
Our guest is hungry.
This way for your num-nums.
Maugrim
You know what to do.
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!
- Oh, right then.      - What's she doing?
Oh, you'II be thanking me Iater.
It's a Iong journey and Beaver gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.
I'm cranky now!
Take them.
- Do you think we'II need jam?      - OnIy if the Witch serves toast.
Hurry.
Badger and me dug this. Comes out right near his pIace.
You toId me it Ied to your mum's!
Lucy!
They're in the tunneI.
- Quick! This way.      - Hurry!
- Run!      - Quick! Quick! Quick!
You shouId have brought a map!
There wasn't room next to the jam.
Come on, Lucy!
I'm so sorry, dear.
He was my best mate.
What happened here?
This is what becomes of those who cross the Witch.
You take one more step, traitor, and I'II chew you to spIinters!
ReIax. I'm one of the good guys.
Yeah? WeII, you Iook an awfuI Iot Iike one of the bad ones.
An unfortunate famiIy resembIance.
But we can argue breeding Iater. Right now we've got to move.
What did you have in mind?
Greetings, gents.
- Lost something, have we?      - Don't patronize me!
I know where your aIIegiance Iies.
We're Iooking for some humans.
Humans? Here in Narnia?
That's a vaIuabIe bit of information, don't you think?
Your reward is your Iife.
It's not much,
but still.
Where are the fugitives?
North. They ran north.
SmeII them out.
They were heIping Tumnus. The Witch got here before I did.
Ow! Oh!
Are you aII right?
Well, I wish I could say their bark was worse than their bite. Ow!
Stop squirming! You're worse than Beaver on bath day.
Worst day of the year.
Thank you for your kindness,
but that's aII the cure I have time for.
You're Ieaving?
It has been a pIeasure, My Queen, and an honor, but time is short
and AsIan himseIf has asked me to gather more troops.
- You've seen AsIan?      - What's he Iike?
Like everything we've ever heard.
You'II be gIad to have him by your side in the battIe against the Witch.
But we're not pIanning on fighting any witch.
But sureIy, King Peter, the prophecy!
We can't go to war without you.
We just want our brother back.
If...
If you're not going to eat that...
I'd get up, but...
...but my Iegs.
Mr. Tumnus.
What's Ieft of him.
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.      - I'm Edmund.
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.
Is your sister aII right?
Is she safe?
I don't know.
My poIice tore that dam apart.
Your IittIe famiIy are nowhere to be found.
- Where did they go?      - I don't know!
Then you're of no further use to me.
Wait! The beaver said something about AsIan!
AsIan?
Where?
- I...      - He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.
He can't be expected to know anything.
I said... where is AsIan?
I... I don't know.
I Ieft before they said anything.
I wanted to see you!
Guard!
Your Majesty.
- ReIease the faun.
Do you know why you're here, faun?
Because I beIieve in a free Narnia.
You're here...
because he turned you in.
For sweeties.
Take him upstairs.
And ready my sIeigh.
Edmund misses his famiIy.
Now, AsIan's camp is near the Stone TabIe
- just across the frozen river.      - River?
The river's been frozen soIid for a hundred years.
- It's so far.      - It's the worId, dear.
Did you expect it to be smaII?
Smaller.
When you're ready, Son of Adam.
Come on, humans! WhiIe we're still young.
If he teIIs us to hurry one more time,
I'm gonna turn him into a big, fIuffy hat.
Hurry up! Come on!
- He is getting a IittIe bossy.      - Behind you! It's her!
Run! Run!
Hurry!
Inside!
Dive! Dive!
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!
Maybe she's gone.
- I suppose I'II go Iook.      - No!
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.
WeII, neither are you, Beaver.
Thanks, sweetheart.
- What's that? What's... - Shh, shh, shh.
- Come out! Come out! - [shrieks]
I hope you've aII been good 'cause there's someone here to see you!
Merry Christmas, sir.
It certainIy is, Lucy, since you have arrived.
Look, I've put up with a Iot since I got here, but this...
- We thought you were the Witch. - Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,
but in my defense, I have been driving one of these Ionger than the Witch.
I thought there was no Christmas in Narnia.
No. For a Iong time.
But the hope that you have brought, Your Majesties,
is finaIIy starting to weaken the Witch's power.
StiII, I dare say you couId do with these.
- [chuckIing] - Presents!
The juice of the fire-fIower.
One drop wiII cure any injury.
And though I hope you never have to use it...
Thank you, sir,
but I think I couId be brave enough.
I'm sure you couId.
But battIes are ugIy affairs.
Susan.
Trust in this bow and it wiII not easiIy miss.
What happened to ''battIes are ugIy affairs''?
Though you don't seem to have a probIem making yourseIf heard,
bIow on this and wherever you are,
heIp wiII come.
Thanks.
Peter.
The time to use these may be near at hand.
Thank you, sir.
These are tooIs, not toys.
Bear them weII and wiseIy.
Now, I must be off.
Winter is aImost over,
and things do piIe up when you've been gone a hundred years.
Long Iive AsIan!
And Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas!
- See you next year! - Goodbye!
ToId you he was reaI.
He said winter was aImost over.
You know what that means.
No more ice.
- We need to cross, now! - Don't beavers make dams?
- I'm not that fast, dear. - [Peter] Come on!
Wait! WiII you think about this for a minute?
- We don't have a minute. - I'm just trying to be reaIistic.
No, you're trying to be smart. As usuaI.
Wait. Maybe I shouId go first.
Maybe you shouId.
You've been sneaking second heIpings, haven't you?
WeII, you never know which meaI's gonna be your Iast.
- EspeciaIIy with your cooking. - [ice creaking]
If Mum knew what we were doing...
Mum's not here.
Oh, no!
Run!
[Susan] Hurry!
- [grunts] - No!
Peter!
Put that down, boy.
- Someone couId get hurt. - Don't worry about me!
Run him through!
Leave now whiIe you can, and your brother Ieaves with you.
Stop, Peter! Maybe we shouId Iisten to him!
[chuckIes] Smart girI.
Don't Iisten to him! KiII him! KiII him now!
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.
AII my Queen wants is for you to take your famiIy and go.
Look, just because some man in a red coat hands you a sword,
it doesn't make you a hero! Just drop it!
No, Peter! Narnia needs you!
Gut him whiIe you stiII have a chance!
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam? I won't wait forever.
And neither wiII the river.
Peter!
HoId onto me!
[shivering] LoveIy.
What have you done?
[Lucy] Has anyone seen my coat?
[Mr. Beaver] Don't you worry, dear.
Your brother's got you weII Iooked after.
And I don't think you'II be needing those coats anymore.
It's so warm out.
I'II go and check the sIeigh.
[woIf] Your Majesty.
We found the traitor.
He was raIIying your enemies near the Shuddering Woods.
Ah. Nice of you to drop in.
You were so heIpfuI to my woIves Iast night.
Perhaps you can heIp me now.
- Forgive me, Your Majesty. - Oh, don't waste time with fIattery.
Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actuaIIy taIking to you.
Where are the humans headed?
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said something about the Stone TabIe,
and that AsIan had an army there.
An army?
Thank you, Edmund.
I'm gIad this creature got to see some honesty...
- ...before he dies. - No!
Think about whose side you're on, Edmund.
Mine...
...or theirs.
Go on ahead. Gather the faithfuI.
If it's a war AsIan wants...
...it's a war he shaII get.
Why are they aII staring at us?
Maybe they think you Iook funny.
Oi, stop your fussing. You Iook IoveIy.
We have come to see AsIan.
WeIcome, Peter, Son of Adam.
WeIcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters of Eve.
And weIcome to you, Beavers. You have my thanks.
But where is the fourth?
That's why we're here, sir.
We need your heIp.
We had a IittIe troubIe aIong the way.
Our brother's been captured by the White Witch.
Captured? How couId this happen?
- He betrayed them, Your Majesty. - [crowd murmurs]
- Then he has betrayed us aII! - Peace, Oreius.
I'm sure there's an expIanation.
It's my fauIt, reaIIy.
I was too hard on him.
We aII were.
Sir, he's our brother.
I know, dear one.
But that onIy makes the betrayaI aII the worse.
This may be harder than you think.
That is Cair ParaveI, the castIe of the four thrones.
In one of which you wiII sit, Peter, as High King.
You doubt the prophecy?
No. That's just it.
AsIan, I'm not what you aII think I am.
Peter Pevensie, formerIy of FinchIey.
Beaver aIso mentioned that you pIanned on turning him into a hat.
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,
more powerfuI than any of us,
that ruIes over aII of Narnia.
It defines right from wrong,
and governs aII our destinies.
Yours... and mine.
But I couIdn't even protect my own famiIy.
You've brought them safeIy this far.
Not aII of them.
Peter, I wiII do what I can to heIp your brother,
but I need you to consider what I ask of you.
I, too, want my famiIy safe.
Is our IittIe prince uncomfortabIe?
Does he want his piIIow fIuffed?
SpeciaI treatment for the speciaI boy!
Isn't that what you wanted?
[Lucy] You Iook Iike Mum.
Mum hasn't had a dress Iike this since before the war.
We shouId bring her one back. A whoIe trunk fuII!
If we ever get back.
I'm sorry I'm Iike that.
We used to have fun together, didn't we?
Yes. Before you got boring.
Oh, reaIIy?
PIease don't try to run.
- We're tired. - And we prefer to kiII you quickIy.
Hello   Chicago.
If there is anyone out there
who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible
who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time
who still questions the power of our democracy
tonight is your answer.
It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches
in numbers this nation has never seen
by people who waited three hours and four hours
many for the first time in their lives
because they believed that this time must be different
that their voices could be that difference.
It's the answer spoken by young and old
rich and poor
Democrat and Republican
black   white
Hispanic   Asian   Native American
gay   straight
disabled and not disabled.
Americans who sent a message to the world
that we have never been just a collection of individuals
or a collection of red states and blue states.
We are   and always will be   the United States of America.
It's the answer that led those who've been told for so long
by so many to be cynical and fearful
and doubtful about what we can achieve
to put their hands on the arc of history
and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.
It's been a long time coming
but tonight   because of what we did on this date
in this election at this defining moment
change has come to America.
A little bit earlier this evening
I received an extraordinarily gracious call from Senator McCain.
Senator McCain fought long and hard in this campaign.
And he's fought even longer and harder
for the country that he loves.
He has endured sacrifices for America
that most of us cannot begin to imagine.
We are better off for the service
rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
I congratulate him;
I congratulate Governor Palin for all that they've achieved.
And I look forward to working with them
to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.
I want to thank my partner in this journey
a man who campaigned from his heart
and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton...
and rode with on the train home to Delaware
the vice president-elect of the United States   Joe Biden.
And I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support
of my best friend for the last 16 years...
the rock of our family
the love of my life
the nation's next first lady...
I love you both
more than you can imagine.
And you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the new White House.
And while she's no longer with us
I know my grandmother's watching
along with the family that made me who I am.
I miss them tonight.
I know that my debt to them is beyond measure.
To my sister Maya   my sister Alma   all my other brothers and sisters
thank you so much for all the support that you've given me.
I am grateful to them.
And to my campaign manager   David Plouffe
the unsung hero of this campaign
who built the best --
the best political campaign   I think   in the history of the United States of America.
To my chief strategist David Axelrod.
who's been a partner with me every step of the way.
To the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics.
you made this happen   and I am forever grateful
for what you've sacrificed to get it done.
But above all
I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to.
It belongs to you.
It belongs to you.
I was never the likeliest candidate for this office.
We didn't start with much money or many endorsements.
Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington.
It began in the backyards of Des Moines
and the living rooms of Concord
and the front porches of Charleston.
It was built by working men and women
who dug into what little savings they had to give $5
and $10 and $20 to the cause.
It grew strength from the young people
who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy.
who left their homes and their families
for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep.
It drew strength from the not-so-young people
who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers
and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized
and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people
by the people   and for the people
has not perished from the Earth.
This is your victory.
And I know you didn't do this just to win an election.
And I know you didn't do it for me.
You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead.
For even as we celebrate tonight
we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring
are the greatest of our lifetime --
two wars   a planet in peril
the worst financial crisis in a century.
Even as we stand here tonight
we know there are brave Americans
waking up in the deserts of Iraq
and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us.
There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and  wonder
how they'll make the mortgage
or pay their doctors' bills
or save enough for their child's college education.
There's new energy to harness
new jobs to be created   new schools to build
and threats to meet   alliances to repair.
The road ahead will be long.
Our climb will be steep.
We may not get there in one year or even in one term.
But   America   I have never been more hopeful
than I am tonight that we will get there.
I promise you   we as a people will get there.
Yes we can!
Yes we can!
There will be setbacks and false starts.
There are many who won't agree with every decision
or policy I make as president.
And we know the government can't solve every problem.
But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face.
I will listen to you
especially when we disagree.
And   above all   I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation
the only way it's been done in America for 221 years --
block by block   brick by brick
calloused hand by calloused hand.
What began 21 months ago
in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night.
This victory alone is not the change we seek.
It is only the chance for us to make that change.
And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were.
It can't happen without you
without a new spirit of service   a new spirit of sacrifice.
So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism
of responsibility
where each of us resolves to pitch in
and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.
Let us remember that   if this financial crisis taught us anything
it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers.
In this country   we rise or fall as one nation   as one people.
Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness
and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.
Let's remember that it was a man from this state
who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House
a party founded on the values of self-reliance
and individual liberty and national unity.
Those are values that we all share.
And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight
we do so with a measure of humility
and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.
As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours
we are not enemies but friends.
Though passion may have strained
it must not break our bonds of affection.
And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn
I may not have won your vote tonight
but I hear your voices.
I need your help.
And I will be your president   too.
And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores
from parliaments and palaces
to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world
our stories are singular   but our destiny is shared
and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.
To those --
to those who would tear the world down:
We will defeat you.
To those who seek peace and security: We support you.
And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon
still burns as bright: Tonight we proved once more
that the true strength of our nation
comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth
but from the enduring power of our ideals:
democracy   liberty   opportunity and unyielding hope.
That's the true genius of America:
that America can change.
Our union can be perfected.
What we've already achieved
gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.
This election had many firsts
and many stories that will be told for generations.
But one that's on my mind tonight's about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta.
She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this  election
except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.
She was born just a generation past slavery;
a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky;
when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons --
because she was a woman
and because of the color of her skin.
And tonight
I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America
the heartache and the hope;
the struggle and the progress;
the times we were told that we can't
and the people who pressed on with that American creed:
Yes we can.
At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed
she lived to see them stand up and speak out
and reach for the ballot.
Yes we can.
When there was despair in the dust bowl
and depression across the land
she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal
new jobs
a new sense of common purpose.
Yes we can.
When the bombs fell on our harbor
and tyranny threatened the world
she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness
and a democracy was saved.
Yes we can.
She was there for the buses in Montgomery
the hoses in Birmingham   a bridge in Selma
and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that
"We Shall Overcome."
Yes we can.
A man touched down on the moon
a wall came down in Berlin
a world was connected by our own science and imagination.
And this year   in this election
she touched her finger to a screen
and cast her vote
because after 106 years in America
through the best of times and the darkest of hours
she knows how America can change.
Yes we can.
America   we have come so far.
We have seen so much.
But there is so much more to do.
So tonight   let us ask ourselves --
if our children should live to see the next century;
if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper
what change will they see?
What progress will we have made?
This is our chance to answer that call.
This is our moment.
This is our time
to put our people back to work
and open doors of opportunity for our kids;
to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace;
to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth
that   out of many   we are one;
that while we breathe   we hope.
And where we are met with cynicism and doubts
and those who tell us that we can't
we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people:
Yes   we can.
Thank you.
God bless you.
And may God bless the United States of America.
and here comes，the Vice President  Joe Biden.
President Barack Obama's Inaugural Address
-are you prepared to take the oath, Senator? -I'am

I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear
that I will execute the office of the President to the United States faithfully
-That I will execute  -the office...faithfully the president office, the president of United States,
the office of the President of the United States faithfully
and I will to the best of my ability
And will,to best of my ability

preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
So help you God
So help me God
Congratuation,Mr. President
all best wishes.
it is my greatest honor
to present the 44th president of us B Obama
thank you thank you
My fellow citizens:
I stand here today
humbled by the task before us
grateful for the trust you have bestowed
mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors
I thank President Bush for his service to our nation
as well as the generosity and cooperation
he has shown throughout this transition.
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath.
The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity
and the still waters of peace
Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds
and raging storms.
At these moments America has carried on not simply
because of the skill or vision of those in high office,
but because We the People
have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers,
and true to our founding documents.
So it has been
So it must be with this generation of Americans
That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood
Our nation is at war
against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred
Our economy is badly weakened,
a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some
but also our collective failure to make hard choices
and prepare the nation for a new age
Homes have been lost;
jobs shed; businesses shuttered
Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many
and each day brings further evidence that
the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries
and threaten our planet.
These are the indicators of crisis
subject to data and statistics.
Less measurable but no less profound
is a sapping of confidence across our land
a nagging fear that
Americas decline is inevitable
and that the next generation must lower its sights.
Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real
They are serious and they are many.
They will not be met easily or in a short span of time
But know this, America - they will be met.
On this day
we gather because
we have chosen hope over fear
unity of purpose over conflict and discord.
On this day
we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances
and false promises, the recriminations
and worn out dogmas
that for far too long have strangled our politics.
We remain a young nation
but in the words of Scripture
the time has come to set aside childish things
The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit
to choose our better history
to carry forward that precious gift
that noble idea
passed on from generation to generation:
the God-given promise that all are equal
all are free, and all deserve a chance
to pursue their full measure of happiness.
In reaffirming the greatness of our nation
we understand that greatness is never a given
It must be earned
Our journey has never been
one of short-cuts or settling for less.
It has not been the path for the faint-hearted
for those who prefer leisure over work
or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame
Rather, it has been the risk-takers
the doers, the makers of things
some celebrated but more often
men and women obscure in their labor
who have carried us up the long,rugged path
towards prosperity and freedom.
For us
they packed up their few worldly possessions
and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.
For us
they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West
endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
For us, they fought and died
in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sanh.
Time and again these men and women struggled
and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw
so that we might live a better life
They saw America as bigger
than the sum of our individual ambitions
greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
This is the journey we continue today
This is the journey we continue today
We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth
Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began
Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began
Our minds are no less inventive
our goods and services no less needed
than they were last week or last month or last year
Our capacity remains undiminished.
But our time of standing pat
of protecting narrow interests
and putting off unpleasant decisions
that time has surely passed
Starting today
we must pick ourselves up
dust ourselves off
and begin again the work of remaking America.
For everywhere we look
there is work to be done
The state of the economy calls for action
bold and swift, and we will act
not only to create new jobs
but to lay a new foundation for growth
We will build the roads and bridges
the electric grids and digital lines
that feed our commerce and bind us together
We will restore science to its rightful place
and wield technologys wonders
to raise health cares quality and lower its cost
We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil
to fuel our cars and run our factories.
And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities
to meet the demands of a new age
All this we can do
And all this we will do.
Now
there are some who question the scale of our ambitions
who suggest that our system
cannot tolerate too many big plans
Their memories are short.
For they have forgotten what this country has already done
what free men and women can achieve when
imagination is joined to common purpose
and necessity to courage.
What the cynics fail to understand is that
the ground has shifted beneath them
that the stale political arguments that have consumed us
for so long no longer apply
The question we ask today
is not whether our government is too big or too small
but whether it works
whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage
whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage
care they can afford
care they can afford
a retirement that is dignified
Where the answer is yes
we intend to move forward
Where the answer is no
programs will end.
And those of us who manage the publics dollars
will be held to account
to spend wisely
reform bad habits
and do our business in the light of day
because only then can we restore
the vital trust between a people and their government.|
Nor is the question before us
whether the market is a force for good or ill.
Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched
but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye,
the market can spin out of control
and that a nation cannot prosper long
when it favors only the prosperous
The success of our economy has always depended
not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product
but on the reach of our prosperity
on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart
not out of charity
but because it is the surest route to our common good.
As for our common defense
we reject as false the choice
between our safety and our ideals.
Our Founding Fathers Our Founding Fathers
faced with perils we can scarcely imagine
drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man
a charter expanded by the blood of generations
a charter expanded by the blood of generations
Those ideals still light the world,
and we will not give them up for expediences sake
And so to all other peoples and governments
who are watching today
from the grandest capitals
to the small village where my father was born
know that America is a friend of each nation
and every man, woman, and child
who seeks a future of peace and dignity,
and that we are ready to lead once more.
Recall that earlier generations
faced down fascism and communism
not just with missiles and tanks
but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions
They understood that our power alone cannot protect us
nor does it entitle us to do as we please.
Instead, they knew that
our power grows through its prudent use
our security emanates from the justness of our cause
the force of our example,
the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
We are the keepers of this legacy.
Guided by these principles once more,
we can meet those new threats
that demand even greater effort
even greater cooperation and understanding between nations
We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people
We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people
and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan
With old friends and former foes
we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat
and roll back the specter of a warming planet
We will not apologize for our way of life
nor will we waver in its defense
and for those who seek to advance their aims
by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents
we say to you now that our spirit is stronger
and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us,
and we will defeat you.
For we know
that our patchwork heritage is a strength
not a weakness
We are a nation of Christians and Muslims
Jews and Hindus
and non-believers
We are shaped by every language and culture
drawn from every end of this Earth
and because we have tasted the bitter swill
of civil war and segregation
and emerged from that dark chapter
stronger and more united
we cannot help but believe
that the old hatreds shall someday pass
that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve
that as the world grows smaller,
our common humanity shall reveal itself;
and that America must play its role
in ushering in a new era of peace.
To the Muslim world
we seek a new way forward
based on mutual interest and mutual respect
To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict
or blame their societys ills on the West
know that your people will judge you
on what you can build
not what you destroy
To those ........
To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit
and the silencing of dissent
know that you are on the wrong side of history
but that we will extend a hand
if you are willing to unclench your fist.
To the people of poor nations
we pledge to work alongside you
to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow
to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow
to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds
to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds
And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty
we say we can no longer afford
indifference to suffering outside our borders
nor can we consume the worlds resources
without regard to effect
For the world has changed
and we must change with it.
As we consider the road that unfolds before us
we remember with humble gratitude
those brave Americans who, at this very hour
patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains
They have something to tell us today
just as the fallen heroes
who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages
We honor them not only
because they are guardians of our liberty
but because they embody the spirit of service;
a willingness to find meaning
in something greater than themselves
And yet, at this moment
a moment that will define a generation
it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.|
For as much as government can do and must do
it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people
upon which this nation relies
It is the kindness to take in a stranger
when the levees break
the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours
than see a friend lose their job which sees us
through our darkest hours
It is the firefighters courage
to storm a stairway filled with smoke
but also a parents willingness to nurture a child
that finally decides our fate.
Our challenges may be new
The instruments with which we meet them may be new.
But those values upon which our success depends
honesty and hard work
courage and fair play
tolerance and curiosity
loyalty and patriotism
these things are old
These things are true
They have been the quiet force of progress
throughout our history
What is demanded then is a return to these truths
What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility
a recognition, on the part of every American
that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world
duties that we do not grudgingly accept
but rather seize gladly
firm in the knowledge that there is nothing
so satisfying to the spirit
so defining of our character
than giving our all to a difficult task
This is the price and the promise of citizenship
This is the source of our confidence
the knowledge that God calls on us
to shape an uncertain destiny.
This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed
This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed
why men and women and children of every race and every faith
can join in celebration across this magnificent mall
and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago
might not have been served at a local restaurant
can now stand before you
to take a most sacred oath.
So let us mark this day with remembrance
of who we are and how far we have traveled.
of who we are and how far we have traveled.
In the year of Americas birth
in the coldest of months
a small band of patriots huddled by
dying campfires on the shores of an icy river.
The capital was abandoned.
The enemy was advancing.
The snow was stained with blood.
At a moment when the outcome of
our revolution was most in doubt,
the father of our nation ordered
these words be read to the people:
"Let it be told to the future world...</i>
that in the depth of winter</i>
when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...</i>
when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...</i>
that the city and the country,</i>
alarmed at one common danger</i>
came forth to meet it."</i>
America.
In the face of our common dangers
in this winter of our hardship
let us remember these timeless words
With hope and virtue
let us brave once more the icy currents
and endure what storms may come
Let it be said by our childrens children
that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end
that we did not turn back nor did we falter
and with eyes fixed on the horizon
and Gods grace upon us
we carried forth that great gift of freedom
and delivered it safely future generations.
Thank you. God bless you.
And God bless the United States of America.
You got do something, my brother is innocent.
He's an American citizen.
Look, there's nothing I can do about that.
Of course there is
back at the crime scene, that'll prove...
Look, I'm a night clerk, okay?
If you want someone who can really do something,
you're gonna have to wait for the consul
he gets in in the morning.
I'm sorry.
That ain't gonna cut it.
Your brother,
where do they have him incarcerated?
Sona.
What?
The worst of the worst are there,
men no other prison will take.
They rioted so badly a year ago,
the guards pulled out,
just left them to themselves.
A thousand thieves, rapists, murderers.
The government just stays back,
keeps the perimeter.
To them, Sona's a one-way street.
What goes in...
never comes out...
unless it's dead.
Somebody didn't do their due diligence on this guy,
and we need him moved to a facility that's a little
more... moderate.
All right?
Thank you.
All right, the good news is as of yesterday
you're a free man.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just my brother.
Right. Well, that's a heck of a story, you two.
That made the news even down here.
And I understand you have a son as well?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.  - LJ-- Lincoln Jr.?
He must be ecstatic about your exoneration.
Still trying to reach him.
Well, hey, tell us where he is.
- We'll send... - Let me handle that.
Let's just focus on Michael.
Okay, well, good news is is that much
of what you're saying is checking out at the crime scene.
The victim did have a service revolver
with U.S. government numbers on it.
And if a weapon was found, then that lends
real credence to self-defense as a motive.
Great.
They, uh, find anything else?
- Like what? - A bag.
What was in it?
A little money.
No, sorry.
Of course they didn't.
Yeah, well, whatever the case,
regarding your brother, I have managed
to make a little headway.
I arranged for a transfer
for your brother to another facility,
effective tomorrow.
It's a lot safer,
- it's a lot cleaner.  - Great.
And if this is stacking up like I think it is,
I'd be pretty confident the charges will be dropped.
He'd be free?
Well, he'd still face charges in the U.S.
But out of there?
Yes.
Is there...is there a mess hall here?
Mess hall?
And some water.
I'm dying of thirst. Please.
Please.
There's some water.
Bite me.
What'd you say?
I didn't say nothing.
Drink it.
You hear me?
Drink!
Hey, get used to it, man.
I haven't eaten for days.
Come on.
How are you doing?
You're so clever-- like planting the drugs on the boat.
That's a big irony.
You are exactly where you belong.
No, that's where you're wrong.
And that's where you're gonna help me.
I will have a court date one of these days,
and you will be there on the stand.
And you will tell the truth that you planted this
and you set this up, and I'm gonna go home
That's funny, I could have sworn you set this up.
I set this up? I'm in here.
What does the Company want with me?
Why Panama?
What, you think I know what they wanted?
They had me.
I did what they asked me to do
arrest you in Panama
hand you over.
That's it. That's, that's...
That's old news, huh?
This is the first day of the rest of our lives.
How about we work together, you know?
Help each other out.
Except every time I look at you,
all I can see is the man who killed my father.
You're on your own.
My husband! Bring him out!
I know he was killed last night
Someone called!
Bring my husbang out now!
Be careful.
Sign here to say that once inside,
you're on your own by the law,
that you're not protected by the military in case of an assault.
And any attempt to assist an inmate trying to escape
will be met with a lethal response.
Wouldn't dream of it.
So...
So...
Feel like I'm on the wrong side.
You're on the right side.
You're not.
Gonna break me out?
Too tiring. All that running.
Yeah, well, maybe you should have lost the cowboy boots.
You scared?
- I'm getting you out of here, man. - Linc.
Listen, the Consulate's arranged to transfer you to a
safer facility until the trial which is about a month.
They say you got a good shot of walking out of here a free man.
When's the transfer?
Tomorrow.
Just... just hold on, man, one more day.
You know, I keep waiting for you to mention a certain someone.
I don't know where she is, man.
Well, you got to find her.
I will.
She's important to me, Linc.
If anything happens to Sara...
It's going to be fine, man.
I promise.
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right?
American, right?
I love America.
NBA. Tracy McGrady shooting the ball in the hoop from downtown.
Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying.
Selling?
I just want to talk basketball.
Who's your team?
Let's go, blanco.
Orientation.
I'm not interested.
It's not for you to decide.
Guards say I have to be out in 15 minutes.
Bring them in.
Well, I hope they haven't been treating you too poorly.
I should hear of it if you have.
I think as you can tell, Sona is unlike any other place in the world.
Huh? Since the riots of last year, they left us here to rot.
They figured we would just destroy ourselves,
but instead, we've thrived.
With the canal, Panama is now
a breeding ground for international crime.
27 different nationalities we have here.
But not one gang.
Not one racially-motivated incident.
It's just... me.
Egalitarianism
I believe is the word.
Huh? Did I get that right?
Right as rain.
That's what practice does for you.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me?
Any history that you bring to this place that I should know about?
I don't think you're quite telling me the truth,
We get the news, man.
You were quite the superstar on CNN.
Man breaks brother out...
and flees to Panama.
But you're not a superstar here!
You realize that, don't you?
I'm not going to make waves.
It wouldn't be within your power.
I heard about the two of you.
You two in the hall today.
Now, if you would like to sort your problems out,
it's very simple here.
A man has a beef with another, he makes his problem known.
And then we deal with it directly
as men... over there.
Won't be necessary.
You always shake like that?
Or just when you're scared of someone?
I think he gets the message.
We could go... you and me...
right here.
Brave man.
You're lucky I've been meditating.
Before, I couldn't take my finger off the trigger, but now...
now I have mind control.
Complete control.
Mind...
body...
and soul.
Get out!
Get out!
He's a waste of our time.
Who would have thought...a famous person in Sona.
Weak people rally around fame.
They worship it. They're blinded by it.
And as you can tell, there are many people
of weak character behind these walls.
Yes, they will follow a man like this,
and they will put him on a pedestal.
He has that charisma, right, mami?
He's no you.
Ah, you don't have to pander me, mami.
Soy un hombre maduro.
He's good looking, right?
He's the best looking man in the prison, right?
Not compared to you.
She's missing.
We don't have a report of anything like that.
But if you do, you call me;the number's on the back.
Okay, ser.
Anything, you call me,all right?
Will do.
Thank you.
Where'd you get shoes?
It's time to start earning your rent around here.
There's no rent here.
It's prison.Keep talking.
It's going up.
Here.
Work time's started right now.
Where?
Uh-uh. Hell no.
Absolutely not.
One more word from you,
and I will drown you in here, you understand?
Now, work.
Burn it down in the sewers when you're done.
What do you want?
Well, to be frank, to represent you.
You're a lawyer? Of sorts.
The court already appointed me a lawyer.
Then perhaps I can be of assistance in a different way.
Somehow I doubt that.
I got a lot of big guns behind me, Mr. Scofield,
people you might like to have in your corner
should you ever decide, say... to break out of here.
Who are you?
We can assist you in every possible way
There's a reason a guy like you,
with your skill set, was put in here, you know.
This conversation's over.
We're trying to do this the easy way.
What the hell are you doing taking my stash?
Cough it up, you little bitch.
I didn't do it. Where is it?!
Where is it?! It wasn't me.
You know the rules about extra-curricular fights!
It doesn't happen here.
He took something that belongs to me.
He's out of his mind.
Well, it seems pretty easy to get to the bottom of this
check him.
Check his area.
That's bull.
You're both
scumbags.
You and me, man.
We're not done here.
You haven't seen her?
No one like this has checked in?
You're absolutely sure?
Thanks.
Yeah.
at the constable's office.
We found an American woman
matching the description of your friend, Ms. Tancredi.
Where?
At the morgue.
What's he saying?
That we can't eat.
What are we supposed to eat?
They expect us to forage,like dogs.
I'll die.I will literally die.
Hang in there, man.
Playing by yourself.Same old Pretty.
Just not good at making friends, are you?
We got nothing to say to each other.
On another note,
on a big picture note,them big government types
that shook me down so hard,
why is it they wanted you here?
Was it Sona they was interested in?
That's what I'm thinking.
Want me to get you down here,up in this very county.
What do you think it is, huh?
You think it's Sona?
Who'd be interested in a dump like this?
Runner! Runner!
No! No!
Thanks for getting back to me.
No problem.
The body was fished out of the pond
- first thing this morning. - Where?
Sir?
That's the last place I saw her.
It's not her.
It's not her.
Someone's thrown the glove down on you.
The gauntlet, right?
Yeah, except we both know I didn't take those drugs.
I'm not the judge.
I don't deal in the claims people make.
I just make sure the rules are followed.
And the rules say all grievances are dealt with
two men in a ring, a fight.
I'll be leaving tomorrow,so that won't be necessary.
It may not be necessary to you,
but it is to me.
I have a duty to maintain order here--
an ironclad legal system that assures that
no one goes independent with their grievances,
as is so often the case in other prisons.
Here,
there is a system,
and that system means order.
So whether you agree with it or not
does not matter to me.
There's a larger agenda than yours.
What happens if I refuse?
We'll come for you.
And I can guarantee you that is an outcome
that you will not like.
Tell me something...
do you always set up your fights?
I had nothing to do with it.
And yet the only one in this whole prison
who has a problem with me is you.
I'd be glad to see you go down...
Go on,keep going.
You burn it around the corner.
Buddy.
Think you can do me a favor?
Bite me.
I can feed you.
A few weeks ago,I was in your shoes.
Didn't get any food for days.
They'd have let me die,
just like they're gonna let you die.
Get back to the "feed me" part.
Chicken.
Man,where'd you get chicken?
That's not chicken.
Want some more? Yeah.
Then you're gonna have to run an errand for me.
What kind of errand?
Dad? It's me. LJ.
Where are you?
What?
How...
How'd you get this number?
She got your number from the consulate.
Dad,I'm cutting out.
LJ,I can't hear you,man.
Dad,do this.
at the top.
Time to fight, blanco
Best to make your peace with God.
all right?
What? Even at 10-1?
There's a reason he chose World.
Six consecutive life terms, okay?
I'm just kidding, man.
Tranquilo!
Surely, it's beneath a man of your status
to be walking around like that
all sticky-like.
Leave him.
What do you propose?
Ablution.
A humble sign of friendship from a stranger
who's come into your house.
Sorry about that.
Just half a man down here.
What's your name,
You can just call me "friend."
Go for the kneecap.
You, uh... you hit it
straight on, it'll buckle,
and you'll take the guy out of commission.
Fighting dirty? That's your secret?
I didn't think there was any such thing as clean
in a place like this.
It almost sounds like you care.
You're my get-out-of-jail-free card.
Just survive.
Kneecap, really hard.
Good luck, man.
God bless, man.
We got a disagreement between two dogs--
a drug addict and a thief.
And I condone neither.
And I wash my hands of both of them.
But they have an issue, and we have rules.
And without rules, we're nothing but savages.
Therefore, with proper respect for the rules,
this fight is engaged with only one rule--
no weapons.
Only man versus man,
without augmentation or handicap.
I'm done talking.
I'm not going to fight!
I don't think you understand the rules, friend.
Only one man comes out alive.
Rules are rules. Remember?
If we don't have them...
we're savages.
Oh, excuse me.
You have no jacket.
Come on, man. I'm just meeting someone. Give me a break.
Well, this is a nice place.
It requires jackets.
Well, I don't
have a jacket.
It requires jackets.
Fine.
Excuse me.
You speak English?
How about American?
Can I grab a water, please?
Please tell me you didn't come
all the way to Panama for the water.
Family.
That's a nice jacket, Sergio.
It's a long story.
Thank you.
You're waiting for someone, huh?
Uh-huh.
I should have known.
Good-looking ones are always taken.
What happened to your face?
A cat.
Cat. It's a big cat.
You push anything too far into a corner,
Your timing's all wrong, lady.
Oh, come on. Hang out.
I'd like to... but it ain't the right time.
We have a lot to discuss.
Specifically, your brother.
I highly suggest
you talk to him.
How are we coming with the transfer?
There are some people
that want you ak someone out of there.
Yeah, I know.
Some guy already approached me.
I said, "No, thank you."
You got to stay.
What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no, Linc, I can't do that again.
Talk.
Dad.
Dad, I'm so sorry.
They got me and Sara.
Please, do what they want.
Dad, please.
You got a week
Get him out of there.
Otherwise, they, uh...
they both die.
Previously on Prison Break
Sona's a one-way street
What goes in
never comes out.
Since the riots of last year,
they lt here us to rot.
They figured we would just destroy ourselves,
but instead we've thrived.
How about we work together, you know,
help each other out?
You're on your own.
Get me out of this! You want to know
where she is, find a way
to get me out of this!
We can assis you should you ever decide,
say, to break out of here.
This conversation's over.
We're trying to do this the easy way.
Think you can do me a favor?
We have a lot to discuss, Lincoln.
Specifically, your brother.
How are we coming with the transfer?
You got to stay.
What are you talking about?
Dad, I'm so sorry.
They got me and Sara.
You got a week to find this Whistler guy.
Otherwise, they, uh, both die.
Where you from up there, bro?
Chicago.
Yeah.
You meet him?
It's a big city.
Oh, yeah, big city.
Thanks for saving me a spot.
Hey!
Ejected!
You ever have sex with blond cheerleader?
Yeah, sure.
You're the man, bro.
How long's the water been out?
Since riots last year.
Government blame us.
They say, "Screw you, you break it."
No water.
Gracias.
Real quick.
I'm looking for him.
Welcome to club.
Everybody looking for him.
Why's that?
He killed the mayor of Panama City's son.
In bar fight.
Mayor not happy.
Hey, hey.
So where is he now?
Disappear.
Some say he might even escape.
Hey. Hey!
"I don't have no money.
I don't have no money,"that's all I hear from you,
you know that?
But then I see you with this, huh?
Life must be good, eh?
Look, I'm-I'm hungry, okay?
You worry about me being hungry.
Hey, hey, hey,hey, come on.
Come on!
But you eat all the time.
Okay, I can see you up there.
Hey, tranquilo!
There's gonna be more water.
When?!
I said there will be more water.
Whew!
Later, bro.
Go.
Spare a little?
I need some information.
Absolutely.
You slipped this note in my pocket yesterday.
Why?
My memory's a little foggy on account of this thirst.
Yeah, it's starting to come back to me now.
A little more agua there.
The note.
This guy gave me some rat meat in exchange for putting that
in your pocket and the pocket of the guy you were set to fight.
Why?
He's nuts, that's why.
Anybody who can live down in those sewers
doesn't have all his faculties.
Where in the sewers?
I was here to get you out of here.
I'm going to assume they told you I was coming.
Or that someone was coming.
Last chance.
I'm not coming down here again.
You're here to get me out of Sona.
Are you surprised?
It's just that it's gonna be a bit difficult
getting me out of this hole.
Seeing as if I go above ground
and another inmate spots me,
I'm a dead man.
There's a, there's a slight misunderstanding
that I have with the mayor...
You know what? It's none of my business.
I'll come back and get you when the time is right.
I may not make it that long.
That's your problem, my friend.
I've got problems of my own.
So you work for these people?
The ones that want me out of Sona.
Look, just stay put.
As long as no one knows you're here,
you should be safe.
I'll be back.
Why do they want me out of here so badly,
can you at least tell me that?
Is this the part where you pretend you're innocent?
Just a pawn in all this?
If they told you anything about me before you came here,
you'd know that to be true.
I just want to know what they want with me.
Stay put.
In an effort to save some time,
I'm gonna have to insist
that we just skip right past all the threats I know
you're prepared to layout.
Should anything happen to Sara to LJ,
you will scour the Earth and hunt me down
and rip my heart from my chest
and bup, bup, bup.
I absolutely know how you feel,
as would I, okay?
So that's done.
On to business.
Did you brother get the message?
Good. You and I will meet here every day.
I'll want a full report of the prior day's progress.
When I call your cell phone, answer.
Don't ask me stupid questions.
Don't waste my time.
Get a plan together.
Execute it.
Are we clear?
I want a picture of my son and Sara to prove they're alive.
Fine. I can do that, next.
Why us?
I'll answer that question
so we can put it to bed and you can focus on your work.
due to the nature of his crime.
Raids, bribes, what have you,
are not an option.
We have to go in through the back door, so to speak.
This can't be done in a week.
You have a week. That's it.
Are we clear?
What's your name?
I'm assuming you weren't
born by immaculate conception.
Family trees being what they are,
moms, da, brothers, sisters.
Anything happens to my son or Sara,
I'm not coming after you, Susan.
Get to work.
It's a deal
His man knocks over the water!
Now, didn't you see how Lechero just walked away?!
He doesn't care about us!
He doesn't give a damn!
Living like a king up there!
Come out, what are you, afraid?!
Come on!
Por favor.
Por favor. Vete.
Vete, perro.
Why you so interested about that guy down there?
No reason.
Then why you whispering, college boy?
Why don't you lower your voice already?
- What's in it for me? - I'm sorry.
Do you have any other friends in here besides me?
I'm it.
-Friends don't let friends go hungry and thirsty -All right.
- All right. - and damn near half-naked.
-I said "all right. I'll take care of it!-When?
When I can.
What's the big deal?
Why's he hiding?
Who's he hiding from?
whoever kills him gets to go to court,
gets to see a judge.
Judge friendly with mayor.
Kill him, and-and
then you get to get out of here and be free?
This'll stay between me and you.
If your friend wanted you to know, why didn't he tell you?
Cause... 'cause you and I are friends now.
Unless you want to be enemies.
Friends.
Good. Me, too.
Sucre, get me out of here, please.
but-but not telling you anything
until you get me out of here.
Tell me where she is right now!
You shoot me, you'll end up inside this hellhole.
I'm done.
I don't care anymore.
I can only guess she's dead by now,
so you're dying with her.
I never had her!
At that house in Mexico,
I told them I'd lock 'em up
for accessory if they didn't hightail it.
I swear to God.
And the crucifix?
Maricruz before she ran.
There was no phone in that dump, so I knew you wouldn't'
be able to call from the road to...
to make sure I wasn't lying.
I-I conned you.
So...
She's picking grapes.
I have no idea.
Now, just lower the barrel.
Put the gun down.
Now, I came clean with you and helped you out,
right, buddy?
So you got to return the favor.
She's listed. Sucre?
I would never do that!
Help me!
Yeah.
What's his tory?
I don't know, and maybe
it's better that way, huh?
I just got
to get him out of here, right?
Come on, man, come on.
We got to keep moving, we got to keep moving.
What's the next play?
on a dead body yesterday.
I don't know what it means or who it's for.
But we need all the leverage we can get,
and, uh...
I need some money.
No one's ever broken out of this place before,
let alone with a week to plan it,
so...
you tell these people, whoever it is that took Sara
and my nephew...
you tell them I get it,
and I'm going to do everything I can.
I'm going to break this guy out of here,
or I'm going to die trying.
And if it's the latter,
then that should count for something, right?
Th's got to count for something.
You tell them that.
I will.
Tell them.
I'd trade places with you in a second.
I know.
You're not safe here.
I can take you someplace that is.
If you're here to help me,
then just leave me alone.
Please.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
For what?
I don't know. I'm sorting it through.
I could use your help.
We're in a... we're in a bad spot.
Uh, I feel for you, man, but I'm done with bad spots, Linc.
I just talked to my cousin Petey,
Hey, you're still wanted in Chicago, remember?
I'll figure something out.
All right.
I won't. I'm-I'm out of here, bro.
I'm going to go see my girl.
Listen to me. The innocent people in your life--
you got to keep them innocent-- if that means walking away
from them, that's what you got to do.
Have we had our laughs with him yet?
He's useless, man.
You want to get rid of him?
Huh? Then you cut the mango. Huh?
You caused me
a big, big problem out there today!
You understand that?
Now there's no more water.
They'll live.
Oh, yeah?
They'll live?
Yeah? Well, you tell them that, then.
Hey, come out, Your Majesty.
Are you scared of...
little people like us?
There's water here.
Give each man a little, hey?
At once.
The kings have their heads chopped off.
Don't worry about us!
We're fine!
He may have ruled the streets
out there, but in here,
he's just like us.
Just like us!
Come out!
What, are you afraid?
Come and look at me!
Come on!
The American in his underwear-- you seen him?
Boy, you're going to be drinking your own urine
before you get any of this.
Why don't you do yourself a favor-- scamper.
But I got something. Oh, yeah.
Get myself killed just talking to your mangy ass.
Andale
But I got information.
Good information.
Are you out of your mind, huh?
Hey! Hey! Hey! He's got info.
Pick a... pick a kneecap, huh?
I got information! I just want food and clothing.
Hold on. Hold on!
This better be informative.
Or it's your kneecap next.
This morning, before that whole, uh, water thing,
I, I heard you and the lads talking
Well...
I just want food and clothing...
Just tell him, idiot!
There's a guy hiding
down in the sewers.
I-I figure he's hiding from you, right,
because you run this place, right?
And so I figured you'd want to know everything
goes on here, so...
Fine, shut up.
si?
Is he Australian?
Yeah.
Yeah!
All right, now, y'all need to back up a tad now.
Hey.
How long you been in Sona?
Three years.
How old are you?
And as far as you know,
no one's ever broken out of this place except,
You Americans ask a lot of questions.
Oh, no.
What's wrong?
Come on. Please.
Come on! I have a family.
S-So do I.
Come on.
Stop!
Stop, okay?
Just...
He's coming with me.
You don't actually think that killing somebody
is going to help you get out of here, do you?
That does seem pretty strange, doesn't it?
But this is a really strange place,
one I want to get out of.
Then I'll help you.
I'll testify for you,
whatever it takes. Wow.
Wow, look at that halo
that just appeared above your head.
It's amazing.
I don't have a choice, Alex... What'd you tell me
yesterday?
What did you tell me yesterday?
Back up. Back up!
You...
you don't want this.
Let me help you, Alex.
Hey, your majesty!
You got to shut him up.
Come on!
I need this bolson to call me back.
I need to talk to you.
Don't ever walk in here
without being called! I'm sorry.
But it's worth the breach in etiquette.
Is it now?
I thought you could use my help.
There are ways I can be of assistance.
No.
nothing to me, man.
I have five consecutive life sentences-- I ain't coming out
of Sona no time soon.
And why should I deprive other men of chance at freedom?
Huh? I need you to trust me.
Oh.
Trust you?
I don't know you good enough, brother.
Si, patron?
Can I trust this bobo?
He's a snake.
He stabbed me
in the back every chance he got.
A snake who stab a man in the back.
I never hear of such a creature before.
We got to stop this!
Just give me two more minutes.
Leave now!
Leave!
That's what you're giving us!
Your crumbs!
how's your television?
How's your whore?
Come on, what are you scared of?
Hey.
I need some, uh, some moonshine.
Moonshine? Or some alcohol.
I need it now. A liter or a gallon--
whatever you can get your hands on.
It's not good time for party, bro.
Bring it to me in my cell.
Vamonos.
What are you...
Stop!
Just come up top with me.
At least you can plead your case to Lechero.
Just get...
Go to hell.
Just...
His best batch, he say.
It's fine.
I'm going to need some plastic bags.
You didn't get it for to party, did you?
Plastic bags, as many as you can get.
Gracias.
Gracias.
Excuse me?
You speak English?
Yeah.
We've met.
I mean I saw you yesterday at, uh,
Yeah. You know, uh,
you could lose the whole grieving widow thing.
I'm sorry, I have to be somewhere.
I've got, uh, I got to do something, all right?
Do what?
Give me that back
or I'll call the police.
You're not going to call the police.
Why does he want this?
I don't know.
He's just a fisherman.
A fisherman?
Well, tell your fisherman friend...
tell your fisherman friend Scofield's brother has this.
Why won't you people
just leave him alone?!
You think we want to be forced into this?
You think we want to be here, lady?
Forced into what?
What are you talking about?
All right, hold this.
Hold it.
Watch the hallway for me.
I'm friends with everybody here, bro.
That's how I keep alive.
You and I are friends, right?
Yeah, but looks like you got enemies.
What I did for you, getting you those things...
No one will ever know.
Stand up, stand up.
Stand up.
Come on.
Back up! Back up.
You can have him,
but two of you will die in the process.
You first? You first. I'll wrap this right around your head.
Move. Move!
Enough!
Let me go down there.
Let me cut just one throat.
Just one.
And then regroup later
with a real reason
to come after you. Shut your mouth.
He's right,
So, what we going to do, boss, huh?
We just going to sit up here,
hope they run out of rocks?
We have a problem.
What is it?
Ran out of water.
So, you mean you've got a problem.
Look, there was an accident here.
The tank tip over.
My men need water, man.
No, I need water now!
I guess it's too bad there's no guards
in there anymore with you, huh?
You could
take hostages, have a riot, make demands.
Day aftertomorrow.
You call me and you raise your voice at me like that
again, you're not going
to see water for two weeks.
Hmm? ntendido?
Now, I'll decide this!
You'll decide nothing.
You're done here.
Now what?
What?
What do we do?
You've been outbid.
Wait. What are you talking about?
What are you ta...?
What are you talking...?
That's, uh, very useful.
Very useful.
Yeah.
Clear as the blue sky, brother.
Hello?
Baby, it's me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I... I've been so scared, I've been praying
every day.
I did, too, babe.
I just thank God youokay.
Petey called me after he had talked to you,
and he said that you might be coming back here?
That's what I told him.
Enough!
Yeah.
Enough!
You have to be so careful.
Baby,
I've been thinking, and, um,
the only thing that I...
that I care about right now
is that you and the baby are okay.
That's all that matters to me.
I'm not coming back.
It's not because I don't love you, because
you know I do--
I love you more... I love you more than anything,
but... all I do is bring you down.
I'm no good for you.
That's not true, that's not true.
Oh, it is, it is, it is, and...
sometimes the only way
to protect the people that you love
is... is by staying away from them.
however long that takes-- I'll find you.
I'll find you, and, uh,
and I'll make you and our baby proud.
I promise.
I promise, my love.
I wish we could go back.
I would give anything to go back.
I wish that, too.
I wish that, too, baby.
I love you so much, baby.
I love you, too, baby.
Good-bye.
Bye.
You know, they told me that your brother
got all the brains,
but I didn't realize you were this stupid.
No sooner do I tell you to stick to the plan,
than you go and hassle Whistler's girlfriend.
You need to quit
Why?
'Cause I said so.
How about that? All right.
How about you beat it, so I can get to work?
I will
as soon as you give me what you took from her.
I took nothing from her. I got a gallon
of bleach, a tarp and a hacksaw in the trunk of my car.
One hour, tops--
you're off the face of the earth.
It's just a bird guide.
I am not going to ask you again.
Toss it.
Tomorrow-- bar.
Progress report. I will be waiting.
So it's water you want.
Here's your water.
Thank you.
So, how are we getting out of here?
I have no idea.
Previous on Prison Break
I'm so sorry.
They got me and Sara.
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
Are we clear?
I want a picture of my son and Sara to prove they're alive.
I will have a court date one of these days, and you will be there.
You're on your own.
Why does he want this?
He's just a fisherman.
Tell your fisherman friend Scofield's brother has this.
Just take the bounty off Whistler.
Whistler don't mean nothing to me, man.
There are ways I can be ofssistance.
Whistler's clear?
Clear as the blue sky, brother.
So, how are we getting out of here?
I have no idea.
What the hell are you doing?
I just...
I need some money, and I didn't...
I didn't know where else to go.
I've got about $50.
Nono.
I'm talking about the millions, papi.
The backpack?
There's all sorts of cash in that thing.
Need a place to crash, I got your back, but the backpack's gone.
Any money I dig out is for my brother.
Remember him?
Tall guy, kind of thin.
Busted your ass out of jail.
I feel bbout Mike.
I do, Linc.
But not all of us got exonerated, you know.
Pretty clear on that.
I can't ever go home again.
You got problems, Sucre?
You ain't the only one,Linc.
That's right.
We're all guilty of something, man.
All of us.
Not them.
I want to help.
But it seems like it's only getting deeper and deeper.
Look, I just, I just want money to get back on my feet and that's it, Linc.
Never mind.
Doesn't take too long for a man to become animal, no?
The smart ones go for his bunk first.
What do the dumb ones do?
Hey, I was here first.
Mampi bitch, you been here two days.
I meant I was the first one to the shoe,
you sack-in-the-box-- now hand it over.
You're asking for a chicken foot, friend.
You want this shoe?
You're gonna have to come and get it.
Leave him. Leave him.
I just wanted to express my thanks
for, uh...
I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.
My mistake.
Anyway, I thought maybe we could make some kind of arrangement.
Maybe I could
help out around Sona.
Come here, boy.
Leave.
You help me?
I'm the bucky massa here, boy.
Me. Not you.
So if anyone want anything at Sona, it's me them will come to.
So do not walk in here asking for some favor
like we have some understanding. No, no, no, no, no.
We do not.
The next time you roll in here like that, boy,
the only thing you ask me for is mercy.
Si?
Go on, boy.
Now, run along, your momma calling ya.
That bad, huh?
It's not good.
You?
I followed that message you got from Whiler.
It's all about some book.
A bird guide. Names and numbers on it.
Any clues as about who he might be?
No. We weren't the only ones following his directions.
His girl was there, says he's some kind of fisherman.
Yeah, sure he is
Listen, man, I, uh, I want you to check something out.
Oh, my God !
The way she's holding the paper
it's like she's, uh,
it's like she's pointing at something.
It's too small I can't read it.
This is today's paper.
It's a small town 20 miles from here.
She's trying to tell us where she is.
I have to talk to her, Linc.
Even if they let you talk to her, man,
they'll be listening to every word you say.
You can't do that.
We're gonna need more than the name of that town.
I'm coming up empty-handed here, Linc.
It's already been three days and...
I got nothing to show for it.
So, if I can't break Whistler out of here...
you're gonna have to break them out of there.
So, what's the deal, mate?
When's moving day?
I'll tell you the plan when you tell me who you are.
-I'm a fisherman. -Really?
So am I.
You're worried about trusting me?
My life is in your hands.
How am I supposed to know that I can trust you?
You don't.
Not recently. Look, I need to get my hands on a phone.
I need to get my hands on some pechos.
But that ain't gonna happen either, is it?
Who you got to call so important anyway?
Absolutely not.
It ain't a request; it's a dictation of terms.
My brother ain't thinking about escape till he talks to Sara.
Aw, that's sweet.
I can assure you of two things, Lincoln.
and two, you have a better chance of banging me on that bar
than you do of talking to her.
I appreciate the offer, but I'll pass.
Yeah? Yeah.
Oh, what if that's a dictation of terms.
It's not a matter of negotiaon.
Government rip out all the phones
when they find out bad men in Sona still setting up deals.
Making bang-bangs just like before.
They just did it over the phone.
Well, if they cut the lines, maybe we can fix 'em.
There's nothing to fix, bro.
There used to be a whole row of them all along the wall,
but they're gone now.
If you have no more questions
I'm just gonna get going.
That's more than your people could do in two weeks.
Show some goodwill.
He'll get his goodwill when Whistler's out.
One thing you should know about my brother,
he's very stubborn.
You want him to fetch, you throw him a bone.
How does Michael think he's gonna get his hands on a phone inside Sona?
What about cell phones?
With all the traffic moving in and out of here.
Cell phone big no-no.
Only one man has access to it,
and he would never let a zanahoria like you...
Let me guess.
What is it?
The weekly from your operations on the outside.
Grave digger dropped it off.
That couldn't be.
This envelope way too thin.
Stuff just moving a little slow on the outside these days.
Oh, stuff moving slow.
Somebody making it move slower.
Set up something at the barber downstairs for me now.
Yes, sir. No problem at all.
You tell that bitch
she nick me with the razor again, I'm gonna use it 'pon her.
You're still alive.
And you're still lovely.
Oh, please, I haven't showered in three days.
Whatever you smell like, it's a significant upgrade.
When I didn't hear from you, I...
I'm sorry.
I warned you it might be a bit... I know, I know. It's just...
every time they dragged out a body...
Look at me.
I promise you when I leave this place, it won't be like that.
Okay.
Now, were you able to find my book?
Yeah.
But there was this guy.
He followed me.
What guy?
I don't know.
Did he hurt you?
No,
but he took it.
I didn't know what to do.
What did he look like? Um...
shaved head,kind of big.
He said to tell you that Scofield's brother has it now.
No one.
He's just, um... he's someone I'm working with.
He's gonna help me get out of here.
He's a lawyer?
Basically.
That's why you want him to have the book.
Look, Sofia, the less you know about this, the safer you'll be.
The less I know, the less help I'll be.
Exactly.
I just need you to lay low for a while. Okay, sweetheart?
What the hell is going on, James?
What is so important about this book?
Nothing.
It just has notes in it,
you know, phone numbers.
It's people who know people who are going to help me get out of here.
You're lying.
Why would I lie to you?
You're the only person in the world that I can trust.
Come here.
Come here.
Now, I just need you to trust me.
And do what?
Nothing.
Sign out, please
You looking for something, blanquito?
Yeah, yeah, I am, I am.
What you looking for then?
Just a little, uh...little something to pass the time.
You got paper?
Go down to the lost and found with the rest of them.
They'll hook you up proper.
All right.
I find you sniffing around where you don't belong,
you'll find yourself in that ring again... against me.
I don't like your odds.
I want you to check something out, all right?
Look at her left hand-- like she's pointing at something.
Well, you'd better tell my cousin he'd better make himself available.
Better him short money than me short patience.
?No comprende, boy?
I need a charge.
go on, get me laundry, no?
Sure thing, boss-- oh, almost forgot. Uh, I talked to the barber.
She's gonna squeeze you in today around 2:00.
If that pleases you, patrón.
Patrón.
I think it's time you made good on all the bad you've done, Theodore.
You and me, we're going to make a deal.
I need it.
No problem.
Shall I turn water into wine while I'm at it?
Maybe give the guy's mother a good rodgering?
She'd be a little old for your tastes, no?
Careful, Pretty.
Don't bite the hand you trying to get fed out of.
I'm not looking for food, I'm looking for a favor.
Why the hell should I do you a favor, huh?
Cause unlike your new compadres, I know who you are,
what you've done and who you've done it to.
Let me get this straight.
You're saying you gonna tell on me?
this here is a religious country,
and I'm willing to bet the good folks down in Panama
don't take too kindly to rapists
and pedophiles.
You want to bet against me?
Listen, mate.
Here's what I know so far.
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,
I know he ran into my girlfriend,
and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.
I'd like it back.
What's so special about this book?
Well, unless it has directions out of this prison,
I don't think it should really matter to you.
You don't know what matters to me.
You can get that book back when we get out of Sona.
Oh, yeah?
And when the hell is that exactly?
Because so far I haven'seen bollocks in the way of breaking out of here.
Let me tell you what I know so far.
Some very bad people who have done
some very bad things want you alive
and out of this prison, which is why every bone
in my body is telling me to do the opposite.
Then why are you doing it?
You're upset because someone took a book from you.
This is what they took from me.
So let's be clear.
This is what matters to me, not you
and not your book.
Hello.
Cousin, how is it?
You tell me, man.
Oh, business is cyclical, don dada.
Ebbs and flows, ebbs and flows, you know.
Seems like there's more ebbing than flowing these days, huh?
You think?
I'm gonna tell you what I think, man.
I think a black heart is trying to steal my business.
Is taking advantage of my situation.
If there are mistakes have been made,
all I need is some honesty, man.
No mistakes, patr髇, I swear.
Well, maybe the problem isn't on the outside.
Maybe the problem is...
Battery dead.
The bloodfire!
How me phone come unplugged? Huh?
My battery dead.
None of you know nothing, huh?
I am the public defender appointed to your case.
That's, uh...
uh, that's great, that's great.
I-I've been putting together
some notes that I...
Looks like I h some great news.
We got you a trial date.
That's really... th-thank God.
Thank God-- when?
June 13.
Oh, no, no, wait, wait, wait, th-the...
13th, 13th, that was last week.
What, we missed it?
June 13 of next year, Mr. Mahone.
Next year.
How the hell is that great news?
It usually takes two and a half years
for a non-citizen to get before a judge.
I've got a guy in, in here, his name is Michael Scofield
and, and he will testify that he set me up
and that he put the drugs on the boat.
Which will all be taken into consideration...
A year from now!
I'm going to have to ask you to calm down, Mr. Mahone.
It's open and shut.
It's a no-brainer for you. I got a guy who can cop to... The notion
of one inmate taking the fall for another
isot exactly fresh
and usually means someone was pressured
into the confession.
Well, here's the thing, Raul.
I require a certain medication
that they, well, they just don't provide here,
and I am...
Let's just say thatt would be good
for everybody
if, um, if I got this medication.
Is that a threat?
No.
No, it's a reality, it's, it's...
Look, if you are asking me to smuggle drugs
into this prison, then...
No, no, I'm not... I'm not asking you to smuggle it.
I'm just saying if you could get...
So... Wait, you son of a bitch!
Uh, boss, it's 00.
You want your cell phone, brother?
No, just be a half hour.
Leave it for charge.
If that phone ain't back
on the cradle, we're both dead, you hear me?
Cause my Alabama ass is not going down alone.
Yeah?
Tell Sara to call me at this number.
All right, but this Susan chick,
she hasn't even agreed to it yet, man.
What? I only have 25 minutes
with this phone, Linc.
I'm meeting her right no but listen,
I mean, God, I hope that Sara can give us
some kind of clue as to where...
Just get her on the line.
Just get her on the line, okay?
This is a one-shot deal.
Yeah, I know, man.
23 minutes.
I'm nearly there.
Hey, looks like we got off on the wrong foot here.
I'm not a violent guy.
It's just that I need that shoe.
I can't hardly walk, and this place--
it changes people.
Oh, I never even got your name.
Now, that's just...
That's a beautiful name.
What you want then?
Well, I was hoping we could make some kind of a deal.
Trade.
The only thing you got to sell,
me no want to buy.
I like me men a little more...
How you say, uh... ?
Not fat. Fat? This is all muscle.
And I'd prove it to you if I didn't think
you'd take things south of the border.
Now, hold on.
This is a negotiation.
You don't have to... I no gonna cut you.
I got clients.
Get.
Welcome, patr髇.
I'm so honored to have you.
Let's make this quick.
Where the hell have you been?
Well, a girl's got to look her best.
This ain't a game, sister.
You'd better back the hell up.
It's becoming pretty clear you need us,
so stop pretending you're in charge,
and give us what we want when we want it.
Starting with the damn phone call.
Hello?
It's me.
How are you?
I'm tired.
Where...? Where are you?
It's a long story.
As it turns out, I don't appear to be going anywhere.
I know. I know.
I'm working on that.
Listen, Sara, I miss how we used to talk.
Do you remember... how we used to talk?
Yes.
, good.
Good, because I saw your picture today,
and I want you to know I understand...
I understand the difficult place you're in.
I don't want you to think like that.
Why is that?
You have to know
it a lost cause.
LJ and I-- we can see it now.
It's a lost cause.
Do you understand?
No, no. No, I... I don't. I don't.
Help me understand. Help me understand.
All I can think of to help is, maybe you just need more time?
It's like... It's like
they're giving you until midnight,
and I'm sitting here 00 a.m.
They're saying I have to hang up.
I love you, too.
What? She said it was a lost cause.
She said she could see it was a lost cause.
So?
She was never telling us where they were.
She was telling us what they could see from where they were.
He's on his way. We need to get that phone back, like, r醦ido.
One more thing, Linc.
Come on, Pretty! Stall them!
She said, it's like they were giving us until midnight,
but she was tting 00 a.m.
What the hell does that mean?
I don't know. Maybe they're near a clock or something.
That's all I got.
Listen, I got to go.
It's up to you.
Leave him alone, huh?
There's something you should know.
What?
I think that barber might have...
Uh... cut me?
Hmm.
No. My mistake.
I...
You know, in facthat-that there
might just be the best shave
I have ever seen.
Boy, you look like you need one today.
I might just do that.
Can't be walking around, looking all, uh, bhuttu.
Who is this?
Find out everything you can about this number.
Yo!
Don't move.
I want to know what
the hell you're doing to James Whistler.
I'm doing nothing to James Whistler.
Listen, we're on the same team, all right?
Take it easy. Just...
Put the knife away.
Put the knife away.
Put... the knife away.
We're not on the same team.
You want your boy out of Sona, right?
-Right? -Of course.
Well, I'm one of the guys who's going to break him out.
No.No. I talked to him this morning.
He has a lawyer.
I don't know what he's told you, orho he is.
I know who he is.
Right. A fisherman that people want out so badly
they're willing to kidnap my son to get him.
Listen,
you need to talk to him.
You need to talk to him.
Where to, my friend?
I'm looking for a statue, a monument.
The lady of the lost causes.
Yeah, that's it.
The red light district.
You looking to party?
You all right?
What do you want?
Let you know you don't have to watch your back.
Make sure I don't have to watch mine.
My head was a free tick out of here.
I don't begrudge anyone
who did what they had to do to try and get it.
Besides...
...you, uh,
never know when you'll need a friend in this place.
Where are you from?
Australia. Good fishing.
You've been?
Passed through.
Small world.
What the hell are you doing in Pana?
I'm not really in the mood.
You're that cop, are you?
I was trying to figure why he looked so bloody familiar.
Then, just now, hearing your voice,
I rememberatching the press when that first happened.
And now you're in here together.
Small world.
You trying to get him out of here?
Extradition or what?
I'm not really in that line of work anymore.
What's he all about?
What's he all about?
I mean, is he dangerous?
What's it to you?
Just curious...
as to what kind of chap I'm dealing with.
I guess that depends on why you'd be dealing with him.
Like I said... never know when you'll...
Need a friend.
for those that he cares about,
he'll do just about anything.
But he'll screw you three ways to Sunday if he doesn't.
I can guess which side you ended up on.
Well...
Thanks for the chat.
You know, I really just came by...
No, you came by cause
you wanted to find out more about Scofield,
but that's cool.
We're squared away.
There. She is there.
That the only thing about Saint Rita in this town?
That I do not know, my friend.
Excuse me?
Is there a clock around here? A clock, uh...
No. No comprendo.
Excuse me?
Have you seen these people?
Huh? No? No.
Clock.
Clock.
She said, it's like they were giving us until midnight.
Give us till 12.
But she was sitting 00 a.m.
Three...
Dad!
Dad! Dad! Dad!
When?
It was the right place.
I just couldn't get to it in time.
Did you see them? Do they look all right?
As far as I could tell, yeah.
You can keep that.
Keep it as a souvenir
and give it to Sara when this is all done.
They wouldn't have gone to all this trouble
to put you in here
if it wasn't possible to get out.
We can do this.
We can do it.
I think we need to talk.
Your friend, the one in the picture,
you say she's the reason you're here?
Then we have something in common.
The woman your brother met on the outside,
She's the reason I'm here.
Well, unless this Sofia is being held at gunpoint,
we got nothing in common.
But maybe you can start by telling me
why the Company's so interested in you.
What company?
I don't have time for games.
Okay, okay, look.
Look, I've been splitting time between here
and the Pacific Northwest running charters.
Fishing?
Fishing,
sightseeing-- whatever was paying the bloody rent.
Now, abo year ago, I took a guy out.
He was some sort of naturalist.He was, uh...
he was taking water samples, measurements.
What for?
I don't know.
I didn't really care as long as the check cleared,
but here's the thing.
A few months later, I get a call from somebody
wanting to know where I took the guy.
And I told them I couldn't remember.
But then these, um...
then these government types,
they started showing up at my flat asking questions,
and I didn't know what to do.
So I got low, I came down to Panama,
and I moved in with Sofia full time.
Until... Until the fight at the bar.
Yeah, and then I end up here,
where those same people show up at visitation
saying they're going to get me out.
And when they do, I'm to take them to the same place
that I took that guy.
That's why I need the book your brother copped.
It's my trip log.
I write notes in the margins, you know, coordinates, landmarks.
I need to retrace my steps and find that location.
I don't have a choice. That's a really interesting story,
but if that book's as valuable as you say it is,
maybe I should hold onto it for a little while,
make sure they hold up their end of the deal.
You don't get this, do you?
I need time to be able to...
The only thing I'm responsible for is getting you out of here.
Whatever's between you and them is between you and them.
I'm sorry
All right.
Do you have any idea how we're going to do this?
All I keep hearing is how no one gets out of this place.
I think I've heard that one before.
The sugarcane's so sweet.
The mangoes' so sweet, the women so...
Well, if it isn't the entertainer.
How about a joke for us, boy?
Not now, fellas, I got to get...
Why don't you do a little dance for us, huh?
How about a little jig, huh?
Maybe you need an extra hand?
You got me.
Yeah, that's right.
I do get you, boy.
You might've fooled him, but you're not fooling me.
Excuse me, boss.
I asked you for privacy.
Just came in here to, to...
thank you for giving me a hand up in here,
but if it's all the same, I'd just like to be
relieved of my duties.
Wh are you talking about?
There's some, um...
loyalty issues going on, and I do not want to end up
torn between my fidelity to you and the reality
of having to keep my nose clean.
I've been around long enough to know
that when the dominoes start falling,
it's the new guy that gets blamed
for bumping the table.
You better stop spinning and start talking straight.
No!
I ain't no rat.
I'm not asking you to be...
a rat.
I'm asking you to be a friend, huh?
As I've been with you.
Okay.
I was walking earlier,
and I heard some voices talking
I want my cut."
Now, I couldn't tell who it was,
but when I got around the corner, I recognized the faces--
the very same faces I've seen in this room.
Now, I got nothing to gain here, okay?
I'm a nobody
w-with no hope of being anyone.
But those that surround you have
everything to gain if you fall.
I hope this makes us even.
But what I've given you...
can't be repaid with one favor.
So I deny your request,
and you're going to stay on
as my ears.
You'll report back to me everything you hear
when I'm not around.
Better than some, apparently.
You know, it's interesting
how you don't seem rattled at all
by our current accommodations.
Could it be because maybe you're not planning on being in them much longer?
It's like I told you before, Alex,
this is the end of the line... for both of us.
How about this?
You stop me when I'm wrong.
The Company wanted you here in Panama alive,
but framed for murder, and thenfor so for some strange reason
you seemed to really care about the fate of this Whistler guy,
and I got to tell you something,
he's really curious about you, too.
Let's see, what special talents do you have that the Company
might make the decision that you're worth
more to them alive than dead?
Huh, what do you say there, Mike?
Am I getting warm yet?
I think you better pop another pill,
cause that's crazy.
Oh, so you don't mind if I kill him?
I think the question is, "What would the Company mind?"
The question is, "What would they do to you?"
To the ones you love?
Busy day?
Not as busy as I'd hoped.
Look, you had to try.
I probably would've done the same thing myself if I were you.
But let's be perfectly clear.
You're never going to try anything like that again.
I understand.
Yeah, but just to make sure that you do,
I left you a little something in the garage.
It's by the trash.
Previously on Prison Break
I just want to go.
It's okay.
What special talents do you have
that the Company might make the decision
that you are worth more to them alive than dead?
Be careful, Alex
They will be buried here.
But there was this guy.
He took it.
He said to tell you
You have to break them out of there.
You're never going to try anything like that again.
But just to make sure,
I left you a little something in the garage.
What's so interesting out there, other than our freedom?
Finds are alive, so the fence is dead
Yeah? Everyone in here knows isthat fence doesn't work,
and it doesn't mean a bloody thing,
because there are soldiers out there
that'll shoot you dead before you get within 30 yards of it.
Well, I guess I got a lot of work to do, don't I?
Listen, mate, I get what you're doing with my book.
They hold your girlfriend, you hold what they want.
Soon those bastards are going to ask me
what progress I've made in figuring out what they want,
You know what?
Threatening the brother
of the guy who's supposed to get you out of here
might not be the smartest move.
I'm not threatening-- we're on the same team.
But if we play games with that book,
people who want me out of hewill take ac
"I never worry about action, only inaction."
Now, like I said, I got a lot of work to do.
Linc, you all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Just all this stuff-- it's starting to get to me.
You know?
Listen, our situation could change very, very soon.
The grave digger for the prison.
I need you to reach out to him.
And tell him what?
It's all written down.
But we got to get started now.
What are you not telling me?
All these people
that have been hurt because of me.
I'm so sorry, Michael.
They did this, not you.
Okay?
It's not your fault.
Just get to the grave digger.
I feel like we're running out of time.
I am just a soldier in this war, Lincoln,
just like you.
I did not want to do that.
Can you even comprehend the intimacy
of the mechanics of what I had to do to that woman?
It's horrible!
Now, if you and your brother are done playing games,
LJ will be fine.
If not, the last thing I want to do
But if you push me,eces of him to you.
and not even that far, I will.
I'll do anything you want.
Just don't hurt my son.
That's really up to you.
I know the past few days have been hard,
for me, as well.
If you want to talk about it,
I know what this pain feels like.
and get my son back.
Michael's got a plan.
I need details.
We need to bring someone
who works at the prison onto the team.
Who?
The grave digger.
Get it done.
Lincoln, I'm going to need that book.
The Company did handwriting analysis on the one you gave me,
and yours hasn't changed since high school.
Just soldiers, Linc.
Different armies, but soldiers just the same.
Nice.
I was the best in my school.
Algirls?
Kiss my ass,
bro.
20 bucks says you can't do that again.
Bet. Wait.
Adjust for wind.
Shut up.
Just a bit outside.
Hey, bro, you know I don't have that kind of verde lying around.
It's going to take a while.
Well, the thing is, I don't have a while.
So, unless... No, no more favors.
All right.
Can I borrow that cross of yours?
Besides, it's not even real gold.
That's why I need it.
Look, I'll give it back, okay?
It's just a loan.
Come on.
This time, I want to know why.
It's light again.
Someone's getting fat off of everythg I built
while I rot in here.
Don't get upset,
patron
I only have a few more hours.
Let's be nice.
This motherless bitch.
You just get here?
Yes.
Listen,
I've been thinking about and, uh, you're in.
I'm in.
Okay.
I really don't have a choice, do I?
What's the plan?
I'm working on it.
Meanwhile, I could use your help.
What do you need?
A black felt-tipped pen.
A pen? Yeah.
that need altering.
I'll explain it to you later, but right now, I need that pen.
And I'll tell you what else I need.
I need you to get your act together.
I need you to bring yourself
under control, because you're attracting attention,
and that we don't need.
I'm under control.
Of course you are.
This is what happens when a system is overloaded.
See? Look.
Son of a... Power is out.
Fix it.
I'm a truck driver.
Hey, glad I found ya. Just wanted to see how
Yeah, well, I've been having a tough time of it myself.
And I was figuring shouldn't be that way
for us, seeing as how we're the only lawmen here
in Taco Hell.
Hey, whoa, hang on a second there, Alex.
You and me-- we were a team
on the outside, remember?
I was your dog, and I still got a lot of bark left in me.
I'm busy, Brad. What do you want?
You and Scofield-- you're up to something, right?
You can tell me, one badge to another.
I can help.
Do you have a black felt-tipped pen?
Not on me.
Then you can't help me.
I know.
You know what?
I know you're trying to escape from here
with that man, Scofield.
Lincoln Burrows, he told me everything.
There are some very powerful people that want me out of here.
And they want those brothers to get me out. Why?
I'm not sure.
Has something to do with a charter I did in Seattle.
What I do know is their end game
is exa the same as ours, and that's me out of this hellhole.
And once that happens,
you and I will disappear... forever.
But I don't want to involve you in this mess.
I want to help.
That's way too dangerous.
I'm not asking your permission, James.
I'm telling you.
I can do this on my own,
or you can tell me what you know
and we can work it through together.
I don't understand everything that's going on,
but these brothers, they're obviously trying
to find out what they can about me.
Let's see what we can discover about them.
Find out what their plan is, see what they're all about.
They're trying to get you out, and you don't trust them?
I don't trust any of these guys.
And yoshouldn't, either.
If you insist on getting into this,
promise me you'll be careful.
Because God knows I will die
if anything happens to you.
Hey.
Here.
I said I need a black felt-tipped pen.
That's black.
It's not what I need.
Keep looking.
He's playing you.
He's playing you.
Do not trust him.
Your amigo, the American.
He's a builder, an engineer, no?
He's no amigo of mine, boss.
And trust me, you do not want
to get under the covers with that...
Is he or is he not an engineer?
Well, yeah, but...
Yeah?
What do you know about the electricity?
Only that we don't have any right now.
Let me tell you something.
This phone keeps all the food coming to the gate.
It keeps my business running, it keeps Sona running.
Electricity die, phone die.
Phone die, we die. We die or youdie?
Boy, you have enough
education, but you're not being smart.
Now, I come to you, that is an opportunity.
Now, I come to you, that is an opportunity.
Be wise and take advantage.
Now, can you fix the electricity
just like you fixed the water?
It's not that simple.
The water pipes are inside the prison.
The electrical lines are probably running underground
along an exterior wall,
which means they're out there somewhere
in no-man's-land.
So, you can fix the power?
Last I checked, they shoot prisoners who go out there.
So I'm thinking the answer is "no."
You listen to me,
and you listen closely, water boy.
Like it or not, soldiers or not,
you're going out into no-man's-land.
It's a suicide mission.
I'll make some calls.
I don't think I can do this.
No, no, no, no, no. You will help me with this.
Look, I will do something for you.
I'll get you a new pillow,
goose-feather like mine, or a small TV.
All right.
Get me that.
You get me that cell, I'll get you electricity.
Look, bro, um, I'm going to be out of your way real soon.
I saw these flyers for migrant workers in Colombia.
It's coffee bean season,
and they're letting Panamanians in,
so I figure, with a good ID, I can pass.
Bus leaves today, okay?
All right, well, before you get out of here, man, I...
I'm meeting someone, and I need a translator.
Linc, uh... I appreciate everything you've done...
It'll just be a couple hours.
Just a couple hours, that's it.
When I was 15, my cousin told me about a job that only lasts
a few hours and, uh, I got three months in juvie.
I can't do this without you.
I'm in Panama, I don't speak the language...
And I can't miss that bus.
I'm going ake money and send it home.
Underground or not, I'm going to be a dad, Linc,
and you out of all people should understand that.
I spoke to James.
He confirmed what you told me
about the escape.
You and I, we both have people in there
we care about.
Please... let me help you.
Your Spanish as good as your English?
Yes, Colonel.
I just have one favor to ask.
It's just outside of the gate.
You, you can bring your men.
The phone  dying.
Make him one.
This is it?
Not everyone has it yet.
We let credit go a week, and there is still time.
The money's in your veins, addicto.
No, patron. I don't use anymore. I swear to you.
I swear to you. No.
I swear to you. I swear to you.
Chin up, pal o' mine, Chin up.
S? Colonel.
Yes, thank you, Colonel.
We'll be right there.
Come with me.
Excuse me. Do you, um...
Do you have a-a, a pen?
n. Pen. Not, um...
Not... not the brush
but the pen. Pen. Pen.
No,  pintura.
Yeah, yeah, pintura. Yeah.
He's leaving you.
He's leaving you, he'll be gone,
and you'll be stuck in this maze... forever.
Thank you for arranging this for us, Colonel.
I'm getting something out of this as well,
I assure you.
You know you can fix this electric problem?
I won't know for sure until we can start digging,
but yes, I think so.
My men will
shoot you in t back of the head
if you so much as look at the fence, eh?
And you, patron, if anything goes wrong.
it will not only be his life that is lost.
You have my word on that.
No worries, Colonel.
I'll keep this boy in line.
I'll dig.
I don't need your help.
Hey, come on, now, don't be proud.
I heard you talking just yesterday.
Talking to Mahone.
You know, about how us Americans should stick together.
help me down the road, right, Mikey?
What is it, a '66 or a '67?
El quiere saber el ano.
ste aqui?
Pues, es un '66.
Y es mi preciosa.
Uh-huh. What is it, 325 horses?
aballos de fuerza?
Perdon a me, srita. Mm-hmm.
he doesn't realize it was at the prison.
Ask him does he want to make enough cash
to get this car cherry by next week?
He knows we're not talking about cars.
That's right.
Come on, Scofield, I know you're getting out of here.
I heard it all about you and the limey.
I'm just fixing the electricity, Boss.
Yeah, right, and I'm just single 'cause I'm choosy.
Don't make me tell anyone what I know.
What is it you think you know?
Somebody called "the Company" wanted you in here
to work with that Whistler guy.
Am I warm? What's the Company?
What do they want with Whistler?
I don't know, but you do.
Doesn't sound like you know much after all.
I don't need to know
how to change a diaper
to know when it stinks to high hell.
You're doing something here, Scofield.
You're right. I am.
I'm fixing the electricity.
Now, you wanted to help dig?
Dig.
Hey, this is it.
I assume we're doing more than just than playing electrician.
Don't worry.
We're exactly where we need to be.
Heat's getting to me, Scofield.
It's quitting time.
You mind telling me why he's even out here with us?
He knows something's up.
How the hell does he know that?
Let's just say I have a bit of a rep.
I know who you are, mate.
Figured it out just lately.
Finally made sense why they pick you
of all people to send here.
No worries.
It's in my interest to keep your little secret.
Can't be trusted.
He's not in on this.
Okay, good.
But Mahone is.
He's looking abouts stable as a three-legged chair,
and he's escaping with us?
No, he just thinks he is.
He needs his meds.
Without them, he'll self destruct.
It's just a matter of time.
And if he doesn't?
I'll string him along, tell him what he wants to hear,
and then I'll cut him loose.
How do I know you're not going to do the same thing to me?
You don't.
You need a hook-up, my friend?
No.
Take your time.
I don't hard sell.
My pduct speaks for itself.
Outside, I took something.
It's a prescription drug called Varatril,
and I was wondering if you...
This ain't no farmacia.
But what I got right here...
it's bter than anything your doctor
gave you back in the States.
That's tar.
Just take a taste, algo pequenito.
You know, keep it in check.
I don't have any money right now.
Then I don't have any drugs.
But there are a few ways for a man
to make a few dollars in Sona...
servicing the needs of others--
not something I'm into...
You think I'm a punk?
I'm just helping you
get well, friend, just helping you get well.
What do you want?
Look, I know you're a busy man, but I wanted to tell ya,
I don't know exactly what he's doing,
I don't think so.
Listen, I heard him talking about escape yesterday--
about breaking outta here. It's he's talking about escape,
why are you here telling me and you're not going with him, eh?
I would if he'd let me, but he's already cut me out.
He says he's square, but I know
the son of a bitch is up to something.
So I figured,
if I ain't running, I might asl tell you
and make my time in here a little bit easier.
Every man fantasizes about escaping from Sona.
Yeah, but they aren't all in no-man's-land with shovels.
I'm gave him the shovels. Get him out.
I gave him shovels too, and guys to work with, just like you.
I worked in the prison he broke out of.
He said he was doing me a favor--
fixing damage from a fire he started.
And you know what I got?
There's nothing he can do.
The soldiers are watching him.
That's what I thought,
until he tunneled out ofy guard's room.
He's buried something in a junction box out there
and covered it with dirt-- I saw him.
Go see for yourself.
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.
Trouble keeps finding you here in Sona, doesn't it?
Let's take a walk, eh?
There are rumors about that you are trying to trick me.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
Oh? Let's hope for your sake that's true.
Hmm?!
But justmake sure,
let's go on out to no-man's-land
and see what you buried there.
Just want to make sure
my men are doing a good job for the colonel.
Get in there.
Get in there.
Open it.
It's duct tape.
To fix the frayed wires.
That's why the power was so inconsistent.
I didn't want the tape to come loose,
so I packed it down with dirt.
Beautiful.
Where are you going?
I got to turn the main power switch back on.
I had to turn it off, so we could work on the wires safely.
I'll come with you.
It's just a switch.
I can handle it myself.
You can... but you won't.
Hey, water boy, it's back here.
I don't need the chain, just the cross.
It's the perfect size and it's not real gold,
so it won't conduct current.
Keep the circuit open--
no power even when the main switch
is turned on.
Take the cross out...
Sona lights up again.
Lechero find out you messed with his electric...
you're dead.
That's why he can't ever find out.
Now, don't make me come get you.
Nobody back there can help you.
Uh, it's...
It's some kind of mistake.
It should be working.
The only mistake I made was trusting you.
Transformer delay.
It's an old prison.
Thank you for your words before, blanco.
Working for Lechero,
not an easy field to plow, comprende?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I comprend.
You and me, we're
amigos, Nieves.
When Lechero is in a better mood,
I'm going to put in a goodord, help you,
how you say,"move up the ladder."
I appreciate
it, compadre,  but I
was always taught
that God helps those that help themselves.
Vaya con Dios.
Relax. I'll get you the money.
How are you holding up?
I just want to get this done.
Good.
Stay here.
You don't care? Who the hell are you to say you don't care?
You're not the only one affected by this.
Yeah, I know; that's the problem.
But you will still just run off and do whatever you want?
What kind of a man are you that just...
They killed Sara and put her head in a box!
And they've got my son!
Oh, Linc, I'm.... I'm sorry.
You still here?
Lechero wants to talk to you.
I was just about to get a little trim.
Lechero said I was looking all bhuttu!
It'll wait.
Did you know about this?
Did you know anything about this?!
Me? No! No! Nieves...
Nieves-- we was friends, man.
That's right!
If you knew he was using and didn't tell me...
his death is on your head.
Patron, Patron, Patron...
I don't know nothing about drugs.
I don't. I don't.
I mean, hell, I...
I tried me some reefer when I was 12,
I almost coughed up a lung.
good
That's good.
There appears to be an opening on my crew.
McGrady, here's your cross back.
And, uh... thank you.
You're a real smart guy.
What the hell are you doing in prison?
Here.
It's perfect.
How did you get it?
It's what you wanted, right?
Yeah.
Good work.
So what's the next step?
Uh... we wait.
And... I'll keep you posted.
You know what you need to do.
What do you think?
When i fix electricity for reason,
but it can't have been to make that fence sizzle
like the third bloody rail.
Unless you want to make the colonel happy.
Actually, it's in bothof our best
to make that fence as deadly as possible.
Now all we have
to do is wait for my brother to come through
with the grave digger.
This is good
for a start
But i want more
He wants more.
You said $15,000.
You said $15,000!
Fifteen to listen
You said $15,000! You said $15,000!
We got it, Linc! I got it!
i want big cash
understand?
calm down
if it's money you want
No, no, no!
What the hell are you doing?!
We need him! He will sell us
out to the cops after he takes
as much as he can from us.
He's packing up to go.
Kill him.
He's going to betray you. Kill him.
Good news, Agent Mahone!
demise of Ser Juan Nieves,
I have now been promoted manager in charge of retail distribution
and customer liaison.
Get away from me.
All in due time.
Now, I'm not your momma,
and I ain't one to wipe other's noses,
but let's just say you've looked better.
I want nothing from you.
But sure seems you need something.
On the arm.
No strings attached.
Get your head straight, Alex.
Come on in, man.
Come watch the match. Come.
Oh, yeah. You guys call this football down here, right?
Very good, very good.
It's World Cup-- football without the silly hats
you wear in America,
where they all jump on t each other
like a bunch of batty boys.
Have a seat.
Come.
Caf?
The only thing I hate more than a rat
is a rat with bad information.
Yeah, look, I'm sorry abut all that,
but my information was good.
It's just that Scofield is a tricky bastard.
He'll try something again. You'll see.
Wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Come on, you guys. What are you doing to me?
Come on! I gave you good information!
Scofield's planning to escape! I'm telling you!
He's a smart bastard!
Come on, you guys. Come on. What are you doing?
No. No.
No! No.
Look, I gave you good information.
u said something this morning about,
"If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'."
Just be thankful I don't hold you to that.
Come on, Bagwell.
Help me here, man! Come on.
You left this in your old cell.
Thanks, Alex.
You're welcome.
It's funny that you could forget something
as important as this is.
Well, I'm glad you found it for me.
Yeah.
Oh. Oh, look.
You are breathing only by my grace, Michael.
Now, you remember the next time that
you're going to send me on a goose chase.
Okay? I didn't.
No, no. You did.
And you think you can manipulate me,
just like you did to Sucre... and Tweener
and Haywire.
I'm not your errand boy.
I'm going to go with you when you escape,
and if you think, in any way...
that you'll leave me,
I will put this piece of metal right in that
very small space
right between your eyes. I will.
how's LJ? How's Sara?
They told me they're fine.
List, uh, the grave digger
is gone.
What do you mean, he's gone?
Linc, we can't do this without him.
We know, we know, that's why we went to his supervisor--
the guy who approves any hires for that job.
Turns out he could use some cash.
Oye, man. Mail call.
This is we're getting out?
Yes.
With a little help from an old friend.
What is that?
It's a chemical that kills the odors
caused by decomposing bodies.
And when heated to a certain degree...
...it eats through steel.
previously on prison break
LJ and sara will be traded for Whistler
are we clear?
this can't be done in a week.
You have a week. That's it.
No one's ever broken out of this place before,
let alone with a week to plan, so you tell these people
I'm gonna break this guy out of here
or I'm going to die trying.
You're going to stay on as my ears.
You'll report back to me everything you hear
when I'm not around.
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,
I know he ran into my girlfriend,
and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.
This is what they took from me.
So let's be clear,
this is what matters to me.
Not you.
And not your book.
How's LJ? How's Sara?
They told me they're fine.
What are you not telling me?
You're not the only one affected...
They killed Sara and put her head in a box!
And they got my son!
you are running out of the time
what's that?
A rat.
"Rise early, work hard,
strike oil."
Just trying to get a drink of water, Alex.
As a devoted student of your work a skills,
I-I really look forward
to progress on your plan, Michael.
I'm looking forward to you getting off my back.
Buenos, welcome to Sona.
Is that your wallet?
Dame tu billetera.
No hablo Espal, uh?
You know what I said.
No.
That's the wrong answer.
I am so ready to get out of here anytime you are.
Scofield,visita.
scofield, you have a visitor.
Yeah.
I spent most of it feeding chocolate to a rat.
I don't have a whole lot to work with these days.
She's got the book, man, the bird guide.
She worked it out.
So we have no leverage.
-No.  -Tell me
When you were handing over the book,
did you ask for a recent photo of LJ and Sara?
Yeah.
And where is it?
She showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.
Man, I'm not in a position to bargain with these people.
I mean, they're pissed.
You break out tomorrow.
Let's just focus on that.
Let's keep on track.
All right.
While I'm working from the inside,
I need you to take care of what happens
once we're outside.
We're going to need a getaway vehicle,
something inconspicuous.
a half mile from here by 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.
You mean a.m.
No, I mean p.m.
We don't have a choice, Linc.
I ran some tests last night.
Military jeeps patrol the perimeter at night.
There's no way of telling where they're going to be in the dark.
They were out there all night.
We need the dark, we can't just... Just...
Please.
In the middle of the day.
Who're you looking at?
That guy.
I know him.
McGrady, my friend, I'm going to need a watch.
Maybe two.
I'm not even going to ask why.
I'm also going to need some binoculars.
Old Guillermo has a pair.
There's no way he'll sell them to you, man.
But they shouldn't be hard to get.
Where can I find this guy?
We leave tomorrow.
This...
This is how we're getting out of Sona.
Getting out of the cell block
shouldn't be a problem.
The grate and bars are weak,
but we're going to need some kind of rope,
some kind of ladder, to let us down on the other side.
That's why I figured out the safest
line from here to the hole in the fence.
We do it in the day,
we'll only be visible to the two guard towers.
The perimeter guards are less predictable,
but they're only on at night.
Scurrying across the fld in the middle of the day?
It's the only way to avoid the jeep patrol.
Now, in the yard tomorrow, there's a soccer game at 2:00.
That should prove some distraction inside.
And yesterday when we were digging,
I saw the glare from the sun hit this guy
in the late afternoon.
Looked like he turned away,
like maybe his vision was blocked.
It's not much of a break.
No, but it is
one way to do what we need to do.
As far as thisther guard,
his weakness has yet to be termined.
If we're going to get around these guys,
we've got to get to know them.
It's not going to be easy.
There's only one real road that goes to the prison.
We don't want a real road-- that's not an option.
What?
Your brother's cutting it close.
You said a week.
Tomorrow's Wednesday, you didn't leave much room for error.
There's not going to be an "error."
Listen, I've got a lot of stuff to do and I just...
Which is why I won't waste yourime.
When Whistler's free, I need to get to him
as soon as possible.
I'm still trying to work out what's going
to happen once they get past the fence.
Once I know all the details, I'll let you...
Lincoln, calm down.
It sounds to me like you
and your brother are in over your heads.
There's a bad joke about Sara somewhere in there.
Listen...
I'll let you know all the details
on I know them, and then I'll call you.
I want this to work out just as badly as you do.
MoreI'm sure.
LJ's fine. You have 34 hours.
What did she say?
Nothing we don't already know.
Let's get out of here; we got a lot of stuff to do.
Seir Rivera?
Who?
You're Jorge Rivera, right?
Gravedigger at Sona?
so?
Would you like a ride?
No no, someone's coming to get me in a little bit.
I had an arrangement with your predecessor.
I need you to get this inside the prison.
I don't go inside the prison.
Neither did he.
How about this?
You find a way to get this delivery
inside the prison
just this one time.
Why would I?
Becuase I would give you
five thousand dollars.
Five thousand dollars?
For just one time?
Couldn't you do that?
I think you could do it.
In this?
You're crazy!
Only you can do it.
I wouldn't let 'em see you do that.
Who?
Anyone. It's a drinking fountain.
They put their lips right on there.
You'd think it spits straight Jack Daniels.
You understand what happened, don't you?
You're a-- what's-it- called?-- a pariah.
I made the same mistake when I walked in here
tried to hang on to my wallet.
Next thing I knew, I spent the next two days kneecap deep
in human feces.
In Sona, it's every man for himself.
Here, cheese.
I'm not hungry.
Yeah, you will be.
I saw the other Americans.
So none of you have called the embassy, huh?
Us gringos ain't all butt buddies.
You want it? Cause I'll keep it.
Let's get this done.
We're gonna have to tch both guards simultaneously.
Your cell should provide
a good view of the guard I saw yesterday.
Keep track of everything he does and when he does it.
Look for that glare, see if it shows up again.
What will you be doing?
Watching the other tower from here.
While our back's turned, we're gonna need a lookout.
Well, find Mahone.
I thought we were stringing him along?
Looks like we're out of string.
Si, patron?
What they say about all work d no play, huh?
Boy need his rest.
Your clientele keeps a tight schedule.
Got to make sure I see to their needs.
I gave you a more important task.
But I haven't heard a thing.
en listen harder.
Mi amor.
Ah, mi vida.
Into my office.
Sit down, watch the game.
Excuse me.
Anything yet?
Nope, not yet.
So what's your story, man?
I mean, the next chapter,
when we get out of here.
Suppose you were married to the job,
drank too much, rabid insomniac, typical lawman.
Yeah, just like you reek of live bait,
have a girl in every port,
tell fish stories
or so I've heard.
Prior to this experience,
I had the utmost respect for the law.
This guy hasn't so much has scratched his jock in an hour.
It's not gonna be easy to get around that guy.
I don't know.
We might just have a break.
I'm gonna go check on Scofield.
Sorry.
Did you see thglare?
13-- he turned to his right
and ignored everything to the west for six minutes,
as far as I could tell.
This guy thinks he's auditioning for Buckingham Palace.
He's also a sports fan.
He's got a TV.
Twice in the last four hours the signal went fuzzy.
He had to turn to adjust the antennae.
That's nothing we can count on.
True.
But there is a device we can build
out of some pretty common materials.
It's almost like a radio, except it...
transmits signals.
Pardon me.
You're the new guy.
Yeah. And who are you?
Not the new guy.
So what's your deal?
Public intoxication, tourist in trouble-- what is it?
I don't like people asking too many questions.
when I've done nothing wrong.
Oh, you're an innocent man.
As a matter of fact, yes.
Is this your first time in prison?
Uh-huh. Why? Because it's obvious--
Rule No.1
you mind your own business.
You know, you might want to do the same.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
You got me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got you.
Go take a walk.
When'd you meet your boyfriend, Whistler?
My last year of school.
I worked in this place in San Isabel.
He used to come around
by himself and sit down in a bar.
Hitting on the waitress. That's romantic.
He is!
Every time he goes away,
he brings me back a present
like this
Those are from Sedona.
His mother lives there in a retirement home.
What's going on?!
Out of the car, Juan Bobo!
This is a private road.
I can explain. Callete!
What'd we do?
Shut your uth, American.
u?paso
This is state property! No vehicles allowed!
All roads within two miles of Sona are closed.
We, we didn't see any signs.
Where were you going?
This your car?
It's my car.
The papers in the glove box.
This is why my friends don't visit Panama.
You cops bother everyone.
This road is not for tourists.
If I ever catch you out here again,
I'll remeber you.
It ain't gonna happen again.
Okay, go on.
Anda.
You okay?
Yeah. This is not gonna work.
All right, time for plan B. Come on.
Found some more of these.
We can make rope out of this hammock.
Come on. You don't want to go in there.
If you want to get out of this place I do.
Stay here.
he Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Move it!
Come on!
What is it, chained down?
It's hanging by a thread.
It'll have to wait.
We've got less than 24 hours. We'll make it.
Tell me why.What?
What's so urgent we can't get
you out of here the day after tomorrow?
I don't know. I don't have all the answers.
You don't me, I don't know you,
but it's your job to get me out of here.
We'll come back later.
I'll take this as well.
Down here for the summer? Yep.
That's what I thought, back in 1985.
Two wives, 20 years later.
Want everything in here?
Yeah, thanks.
International waters far out?
That's 12 nautical miles.
12 nautical miles, huh?
Is that gonna do it here?
Uh, yeah.
Here.
All right.
Thank you.
What did you get?
Supplies. Can you pop the trunk, please?
Who am I gonna tell, honestly?
You could be a Russian spy for all I know.
Live out of this thing?
I have to be
prepared in case of an emergency.
Well, we got an emergency.
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me where we're going.
They killed Sara.
I'm trying to make damn sure they don't kill my son.
You don't think for a second
your boy's not on that list, stay here.
I couldn't care less.
What is it?
He won't
pay the payment for you anymore.
I went to him for payment like every Monday, and...
he said it's not his responsibility
and that I should ask you.
No, no, no, no.
I don't pay for sex.
I know, I did.
But... what I do?
I don't see anyone else...
Yeah?
Well, neither do I.
You in charge of the food now?
No boss. I'm the new gravedigger.
You need to sign in
before you get on the truck.
I was just about to.
Have you read the rulebook?
Yes, sir.
Read it again.
On the other side, when we get out of here,
what's gonna happen?
We're gonna meet someone from this mpany...
Apparently.
And then they're gonna kill me.
You know that.
If they wanted to kill you,
you'd already be dead.
I don't see why they keep me alive.
It's like you said-- you've got something they want.
Once I give it to them, I'll be no use to them.
Right?
I don't have all the answers.
All I know is it's my job to get you out of here.
Let's go.
It's twofer Tuesday, my one-time special just for you.
But there's a price.
Lechero's getting pret sensitive about the cash flow.
Well, I'm a little short right now.
No worries, Alex.
I am notgonna leave you hanging, all right?
We can just start you a tab.
Think he saw us?
Guess we'll find out.
My third year in school,
we studied electrical engineering with a focus on EMPs.
That's electromagnetic pulses.
If you hook up a pow source to a transmitter,
it generates a pulse.
That pulse crashes anything electronic.
What's that, like an intro
an intro into anti-terrorist tactics?
Basically. These days,
they have to teach students how to defend
their structures.
Fortunately for us, that guard tower is...
It was engineered a long time ago.
I'm guessing you always won the elementary science fair.
Plug this in.
Did it crash the telly?
We're too far away.
But it is doing exactly what we need it to.
Okay.
Get out! Why?
They're coming in.
Ahora mismo.
Stay here. Do not let them see her.
Do not!
Colonel.
We received no word of this!
A rifle scope waseen from the tower.
Capitan Hurtado saw it with his own eyes.
That's impossible.
There is a gun in your prison,
and it was pointing at one of my men.
We are going to find it.
This looks good.
For what?
Have a seat.
What am I supposed
to doing here?
Look like you're having fun.
When was the last time you saw your son?
You know, Lincoln,
I don't automatically trust people either,
but at least I can tell when they have good intentions.
Good for you.
You know, I'm not gonna try to prove myself anymore.
You do your job, and I'll do mine.
You need something?
What? You need something?
No.
Good.
Don't you worry. It's all gonna be okay.
No, it's not. I promise you, I will not let
anyone find you in here.
Oh... Lechero hate me.
Lechero does not hate you.
You hold a very special place in his heart.
So many girls can take my place.
No, he's smart. He knows you're better than them.
You're a real woman.
A woman of her own will, her own desire.
You know what I am.
In this world, sister, we are all prostitutes.
You are a queen.
Whose cell is that?
In the corner?
Is that your cell?
You
Is that your cell?
It's mine!
It's mine.
s mine.
I found this.
It's not a weapon.
I know what it is.
Why were you watching me?
i want to ask you
one more time.
Why were you watching me?
I wasn't watching you -- I saw you.
Answer the question!
I don't know what you think you saw but i wasn't watching you.
Lie!
I wasn't watching you.
It's mine.
Why were you watching him?
I... I wasn't. I was, uh...
I was watching birds.
Yes.
Yes.
See?
Why did you not speak up before?
I, uh...
I was scared.
I was scared.
Coward.
Hurtado! Ya. Dejelo.
Come on.
Come on!
please, please, please.
come on.
He's coming back up here.
Now, don't worry.
It's all going to be okay.
You have a little mascara right there.
You need to look pretty for Lechero.
Thank you.
Wait right here.
A patrol passed through, but they didn't stay.
Knock some things over then walked away.
I hid your woman in a safe place,
but I'd be lying
if I didn't say it was a close call.
Is she alone?
Yeah.
Hey.
Don't be afraid.
No, no, my dear.
They're gone.
I should go, too.
No, no, no. What's the rush?
Come on. No, I should
get home.
Patr,
I gave her the money.
I was going to replace it myself
at the end of the day, when I get my cut.
I just didn't get a chance to tell you.
She had no money to get home.
Is this true?
Yes.
With all due respect.
Surely you don't want your mistress travelin' broke.
She'd end up in a taxi
with no way to pay the cab fare.
Ah, you did this?
For me?
Si, patr.
The one that does all
the useful things for me, huh?
And now you do the thinking for me.
No, no, it's not like that, patr--
Get the bucket.
Wash my feet.
So what do we do now?
I don't know.
Well, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Please just give me a moment to think.
Wasting time is not an option for me, Michael.
I need to be out of here by tomorrow.
I know, just in time for be out your next fishing trip,omorrow.
or is it a bird-watching trip? I forget.
That's my trip log, I've told you.
I need to retrace my steps.
I'm doing everything they tell me, the same thing you are.
just, just leave me alone, please.
You know, before I was arrested,
a man came to my flat and took my addresses.
They know the name of everyone I care about
and how to find them.
Well, they already found everyone I care out. Okay?
If you can't get me out of here, tell me now.
because time is running out.
Huh?!
Look, it's hot today.
Yeah.
Prefer the heat than the cold any day.
You know my brother and I wanted to come
down here to Panama
and start a dive shop like the one we were at today.
My boy, he was gonna leave school and help us
start the family business.
When this is all over, why don't you do it?
Too much bad stuff's happened.
Still, you can make it work.
It's only gonna work if... if Whistler cooperates.
he plays games, people get hurt.
You understa that, right?
He doesn't want anyone to get hurt.
I hope you're right.
I want to show you something.
Our getaway vehicle.
Now,
the next time you see him,
I want you to tell him what you saw.
Tell him we're all in this together.
We're part of a team.
You understand?
Okay. Yeah.
All right, get up.
We're coming back.
No, this way.
What?
This way, come on.
Okay
If all goes well,
we'll see them tomorrow.
Job well done. Thank you.
I thought you said I was gonna get five thousand dollars.
That's what I'm talking about.
Nono, no, no, no.
You said one time.
Was it difficult?
That's not the point.
One time is one time.
This can work out for both of us.
If we're gonna do this today,
we got to replace everything we lost.
Like what?
For starters, a new exit point.
It's got to be on the south side of the building.
Look at this guy, again.
I know you, huh?
Afraid not. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're McFadden, right?
Nice, 1997?
Sorry.
You've confused me with someone else.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.
You were with the ambassador.
You've mistaken me for someone else.
Chap's insane.
Come on, guys, got something to show you.
I'm sure I didn't observe the guards' behavior
in as much detail as you guys,
but I did notice something yesterday.
Right around this time.
That's the day shift.
They start by 6:00
Just keep looking, keep looking.
There.
Where'd you get your cup, Alex?
I got it in the courtyard, but apparently it's from him.
He has one in the morning and one after lunch.
Man's got to have his fix.
If we get  that cup...
We get to the man.
We got to move.
Previously on Prison Break
Did you ask for a recent photo
of LJ and Sara? Yeah.
Where is i She showed me the pictures,
but she wouldn't let me keep them.
All right.
I want to know who this guy is.
Said his name was Sullins.
Alex, thanks for coming in.
Hello, Lang.
What's going on? There's all kinds
of suits over here going through your office.
I ow you, huh?
Afraid not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You've confused me with someone else.
You were with the ambassador.
You don't know me, I don't know you,
but it's your job to get me out of here.
We're doing this tomorrow... in the middle of the day.
The ring.
Wise decision.
Want the rin brother?
That's more your style, man.
It's all right, it's all right.
You all go on back. Go ahead.
No, go ahead.
A word.
You should try and be more careful in the future.
Yes, sir.
What's your name?
The Australian.
You said you knew him from Nice.
Is that true?
You calling me a liar now?
He says you're full of it.
He said he was never an ambassador.
No, not anambassador,
TheAmbassador.
I was concierge at the Ambassador Hotel.
I could've sworn he worked there for a few months.
Who the hell knows, huh?
I was high half the time.
Kind of why I got fired.
Kind of why I'm in here.
What was he up to in Nice?
What?
You writing a book?
We're leaving at 3:13-- that gives us three hours
41 minutes. And we still don't have a way into no-man's-land.
ll take care of that.
Your grave digger friends only sprayed the thing once,
And I'd just as soon not get electrocuted today.
Is that an option? No.
Unless he had another reason to be there.
What are you going to do?
Kill someone to get more spray on the fence?
I'd think about killing you if it helped us get out of here today.
You know what'll help us get out of here?
A ladder.
where are we gonna go once we get through that fence?
Just get me a ladder.
This hammock's shorter than the last one.
Well, we might need something to extend it.
All right, I'll take care of it.
I've never been to Nice.
I hear it's beautiful.
I wouldn't know.
I don't care if this guy knows you or not.
But what I do care about is
his apparent fixation with watching you at all times.
Scofield.Visita.
We'll be out of here soon enough.
He won't be a problem
Scofield, you have a visitor.
Hey, buddy, check it out.
Do they roll bones in your country?
Come to my cell, I'll teach you.
You want me to come back to your cell and "roll bones"?
Real subtle.
Hardy har-har.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's hilarious.
Tell me,
are you this friendly with all the shirtless guys in Sona?
I gave you food yesterday.
I gave you a place to sleep.
I wonder why.
What the hell is your problem?
Look, I just don't want to have sex with you, okay?
Is that so hard to believe?
Get a plate.
To make it across no-man's-land,
we're going to have to disable two of the tower guards.
I've already taken care of one of them.
With the other one, we're going to need your help.
Every day between 1:00 and 2:00,
he takes his lunch break.
He gets a cup ofoffee.
You need to find out where and put something in that cup.
Make sure he's unconscious during the escape.
You're dropping this on me with three hours to go?
3:13 is when it starts.
We'll be on the beach by 3:25.
In broad daylight.
The Company still thinks we're doing this at 9:00
tonight, right?
Listen, I can't lie to these people anymore, Michael.
We need time to survey the transfer site,
to figure out if we can get LJ and Sara out of there
in case they try something.
How's LJ? How's Sara?
They're fine.
What about the pictures?
I can't get pictures.
I need them, Linc.
I can't get the pictures.
How do we know they're still alive?
They're the only reason I'm doing this.
Susan says they're fine.
we can't trust anybody.
Now you're... you're vouching for this person?
There isn't enough time.
Listen, if I don't see pictures of LJ and Sara by 2:30
this afternoon,
I'm not going anywhere.
Can't seem to find American cheese down here.
I hope you like Asadero.
Yeah. It's perfect.
A couple of years ago, I was serving in Mosul.
And I was taken prisoner.
A few nights later,
I could hear the sound of U.S. Army helicopters.
Two clicks and closing.
My hands were still tied behind my back,
and I... I ran.
It didn't occur to me
that if this was a rescue mission,
my captors could hear the choppers.
It didn't occur to me
that this was actually a hostage exchange,
and that
jumping would be viewed
as a hostile act.
I got recaptured immediately.
Six Rangers died
in the firefight.
And for the next three weeks...
Let's just say
men are pigs.
Let's be clear.
This is an exchange.
If you don't try to be a hero,
you and your father will be okay.
Good.
Eat.
As you can imagine,
he prefers Lechero.
He kill you before or after he does your taxes.
Kill you when he pleases.
I'm feeling thirsty.
Why don't you go fix us something to drink, boy?
Maybe you ain't got the memorandum,
but I've been promoted.
Boy.
What did you say to me?
What's the problem?
Stumpy herand his mouth.
That's the problem.
I'll talk to him. Leave.
This isn't over.
Leave!
We was just, uh...
No, no, no.
The favor you owe me...
What have you found out?
A thing like this takes time.
I can't just walk up to them and say, "Hey, whoever's been
betraying Lechero, raise your hand." You know?
I asked you to be my ears in this prison,
and you hear nothing?!
All I know is every time I try and sit down and begin
sussing things out, Sammy always changes the subject.
Not that I'm saying he's the guy, but...
I don't want to hear your theories.
I want results.
Is everything okay?
Where is this from?
Uribe's, the roadside
Bodega a few kilometers away.
If I needed you to ID a specific guard--
a tower guard-- could you do it?
I just don't want to get busted.
Could you do it or not?
Yes.
Teodoro's harmless, man.
Hey, man, I wasn't going to say anything,
but, uh, last night,
I was looking for my playing cards and guess what?
I found these.
You're holding out on me.
Take 'em.
They taste nasty.
Man, you cannot get a better cigar than this.
Where'd you get these? Augusto?
I can't make him stop sending them in to me,
but I don't work for him, you understand?
You re you don't mind?
I was in the neighborhood.
You came all this way to visit?
I came to get you out of here.
in 48 hours.
In St. Louis.
Sullins wanted a medium security,
but, uh, talked him down.
What sort of deal is he getting me?
25 years?
Life?
The director's giving us a lot of latitude
in exchange for testimony against the government
in the Lincoln Burrows conspiracy.
So...
how does eight years sound?
Soon as Sullins finishes up,
we can have a van ready...
I don't think so.
What?
I appreciate the effort,
your effort, but, um, I can't do eight years.
You're doing ten now.
The government is calling in some favors.
Once you're in the U.S., if you don't cooperate,
they're going to charge you with everything.
That's multiple homicide counts.
Without this deal,
you are gonna be in prison for the rest of your life.
I appreciate the effort,
your effort.
But I can't.
While we're getting out of here, and...
if I don't make it,
will you make sure this gets to my girlfriend?
All right.
You know, uh... I could do the same for you.
Tie an anchor bend there.
I was just offering.
and you really want to do me a favor,
just hold up your end of the bargain.
I'll do everything I can.
I hope that's true.
How's that knot coming?
There.
Did I pass your test?
I told you I'm a fisherman.
Where are we?
I found a cell that'll get us into no-man's-land.
It's a longer run to the fence than my old one,
but it's gonna have to do.
Which one? Who liveshere?
Look, I know what you're thinking,
but it's the only other cell on the second floor
with a direct line to the fence, where we won't be seen
the other tower guards. And how do we
guarantee that they won't be there?
By 2:00, everyone should be out in the courtyard
for the lunchtime soccer game.
You sure it hasn't started already?
Someone went outside the ring to settle a dispute.
Now, anyone who affronts our justice system
in this way must be punished.
Now, I know the coward won't come forward.
But if anyone has information about this shameful act,
I demand to know.
Lechero wants you. Move your ass.
Now, every day I see you out in the yard,
you play your American sports
and wear your American clothes.
I don't think I've heard you
speak one word of Spanish since you've been here.
I like to practice my English.
And why shouldn't you?
America is a great nation.
"One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
Is that right?
Yes.
Yes.
Justice for all.
Justice for you and justice for me.
And justice for...
whoever killed that blanquito in the yard.
Now, I know why you didn't say anything out there.
But you play your silly American games all day long,
right in front of the stairs where the body was found.
Now, if you don't tell me what you saw,
there will be consequences.
Well, I-I saw one person go into the stairwell.
A-And then maybe a minute later, I heard an argument.
Who did you see?
So after we tie the cord off...
we dig out the bar, we pop open the grate,
and we're, and we're down, right, Michael?
Does anyone want to say anything
about what we just saw out there?
What is there to say?
Well, for starters, an hour ago,
you say maybe we should kill someone
and then someone gets killed.
I didn't say that, and this is exactly
what we should be focusing on right now.
Let's spend a couple of hours worrying
about another dead body in this hellhole.
What do you want?
What are you doing?
Lechero wants to see you.
I don't have any information.
He doesn't want information.
He wants a confession.
I didn't do anything.
Listen to him; he's innocent.
You want to confess?
You can easily switch places.
Maybe now we should start worrying
about who the real killer is, huh?
Yeah, but in this place,
there could be a hundred people on that list.
Except I'm thinking a single stab wound
to the base of the neck looks pretty professional, Alex.
I was in visitation, Kojak.
And what makes you so sure that Whistler didn't do it?
He's the one that had the run-in with the guy.
No, he's got too much to lose. Well,
Whistler's gone, and if not now,
he probably will be soon, so it's you and me.
There's no you and me.
We're not leaving here without him.
In two hours, I'm going out that window and through that fence.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, that's right.
And where are you going to go to, Alex?
Anywhere but here.
There's only one road out,
and the jungle is under constant patrol by police 24-7,
so, again, where are you going to go to, Alex?
3:13, I'm gone.
I told you I know nothing about this.
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't be here.
I can promise you I, I did not kill that man.
Someone saw you go down the staircase.
Stai.. is there any other proof?
My men will find something.
Well, do you see a weapon on me?
I didn't expect to see a weapon on you.
Well, w-why don't they look for that?
You find that, you'll find the real killer.
Or maybe they find where you planted it.
So, what, I'm framing someone?
Well, did it ever occur to you
You know the reason I'm here.
You know I have powerful enemies.
You think my judgment is swayed by the mayor's friends?
Sit your ass down.
When I was 13,
my mother worked for a wealthy man as a maid
until one day...
...she was alone in the house...
with him and he...
Everybody knew what he did,
but because he was rich
and we were immigrants,
the police wouldn't even take a report.
So, a week later,
to gain access through his gates,
and I madeure that fair punishment was rendered.
Now you want to tell me how I favor the rich.
I understand the rules here, and I respect them.
But why the rush to judgment?
Is there a rule saying you must convict a suspect
within ten minutes?
No.
We have all the time in the world.
Thank you.
Now, obviously, I'm not going anywhere.
If you need to talk again, I'm gonna be in my cell.
No.
You'll be right here in this chair.
What the hell do you want?
I don't like you.
I certainly don't respect you.
Stop. You're hurting my feelings.
I've seen at you're capable of,
but I got to say
I never pegged you as a murderer.
You think I killed Tyge?
I saw the two of you in the courtyard this morning.
I was trying to be Nice to him.
He started with me.
Well, if you didn't kill him, who did?
Not me.
Come on, Brad.
Who wanted him dead besides you?
You really think I killed that frog?
How many times have I had you at gunpoint?
You think I didn't want to pull that trigger?
Hell...
I can't even kill myself.
Hey, you seen anyone see Whistler go down the stairway?
We only been out here a minute.
Well, hurry up, then.
The sooner Whistler dies,
the sooner I can give you the chicken foot,
or if you prefer, you can give me the chicken foot--
you know, try and go out like a man.
Either way, you're getting in the ring with me today.
Two drops, and the guard should be out within an hour.
I was expecting Whistler's girlfriend to join you.
Where is she? Around the corner in the car?
She came to me.
I don't mind that she's helping you.
I mind that you kept it from me.
What difference does it make?
I mean, we're done by tomorrow, right?
No more surprises, Lincoln.
What? Say it.
Can you get any more pictures of Sara?
Alive? No.
You didn't tell him.
You didn't tell Michael that Sara's dead.
Can we get pictures or not?
I'm sure we can cobble something together,
but smart move not telling your brother.
He seems a little sensitive to me.
This is the exchange point-- LJ and I will be waiting.
You, Michael and Whistler will meet us there.
Everything goes as planned, you'll have your son back by 9:00.
Which one is it?
I don't know, I think it's the taller one.
I think so, I'm not completely sure,
We've been trying to reach you.
There's another dead body in Sona.
I was just...
Come on.
You want a coffee?
Get me a juice.
Orange juice.
One orange juice and one coffee, please.
Watch where you're going!
Here, look, uh...
this is a buddy's, please.
Please, I insist.
Captain Hurtado!  Here's a new coffee.
No really.
Gracias.
Man, I...
Thank you anyway.
Excuse me, Señor.
I need to go to Sona.
I...
I'm-I'm heading in the wrong, wrong direction.
I really need to go to Sona.
I'll give you a ride.
Come along.
Thank you.
Watch the lid.
My condolences.
You finally make a friend, and now he's about to die.
Damn shame.
You can stop it, you know.
If you hadn't noticed,
my position enables me to hear things.
I'm listening.
The only proof Lechero's got is
that your man went down that staircase, t?
But if you did...
You're suggesting I make something up?
If it makes your conscience feel better,
then blame it on somebody who deserves it.
Someone who's killed before
and gone unpunished.
Yeah, like you maybe.
You want me to tell Lechero
that his right hand man should die?
You don't tell Lechero squat.
this is Sammy's ring.
If you drop it
in the blood by the staircase,
then yell up to Lechero what you've found...
the whole entire
Lechero will have no choice but to comply.
This is Sona.
Don't worry your pretty little head about it.
All you have to do is drop the ring in the blood
and say it was Sammy.
I'll take care of the rest.
You want to save your friend's life?
Someone else has to die.
Explain your disagreement with this Tyge man.
From what I just heard,
he knew something about you?
He thought he knew something about me.
Opportunity and a motive.
That's not a good combination.
You must know there's discontent
from many prisoners over how you run Sona.
Now would not be a good time to insult me.
you execute me, you get your swift justice
and you may placate the masses.
But when they find out who really did it...
they will know you killed an innocent man.
You're still not answering my question.
What was your disagreement with Tyge?
He was a nosy guy.
He got into my business.
and that's what got him killed.
This is prison.
You must respect that.
Look, I've answered every one of your questions.
I've acquitted myself the best that I can.
Now what can I do to make you trust me?
I don't trust anybody today.
You're very pretty.
I mean very, very pretty.
What's the trouble?
You probably don't know this, but...
There is a special visitation
for special people...
I could arrange for you to go inside Sona
and have some private time with your love.
And everything you would need
to assure your entry
could be performed right here in this car.
Yeah.
We have the picture.
How does it look?
It looks like Sara.
I'll be at Sona in half an hour.
Meet me in the parking lot.
Is everything okay?
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Don't you love your man?
I don't know if you know this, but
Norman has a terrible temper.
S?
You're one of Lechero's girls?
S?
I'm waiting.
There was a complication with the guard.
Complications drugging the guard?
Yeah, but it's been taken care of.
Well, that's encouraging,
but why are you drugging the guard
now when you're escaping tonight?
They take an hour, like I told you.
for walking into the wrong stairwell.
I'm thinking this is enough
to get you guys to switch places.
You know what I mean?
What does that mean, huh? What does that prove?
It proves everything!
I'm gonna make sure Lechero thinks so, too.
Michael, I did not kill that man.
I did not kill the man.
What's, what's going on?
Is everything okay?
What the hell you doing?
What's that for?
Your father tried to be a hero.
No, no.
Hey, please, please.
Please.
Please, no, stop! Stop!
Once I cut the spinal cord and the sever nerve endings,
you won't feel a thing.
No, no.
No, no!
Susan, I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to do that.
Dad, they're gonna kill me.
Yeah, they got a knife to my throat.
The truth.
Truth.
Michael's getting out at 3:13.
We're meeting at the exchange point at 3:45.
Susan, please, we did this
because we wanted to make sure the site was safe.
That's it, that's the only reason why we did it.
Sounds to me like you're planning another end round.
Another rescue.
No, no.
We're not, we're not planning,
re not planning another end round.
No. Please, just...
let my son go.
Leave my son.
Living the good life, huh?
Is that what this is?
Having too good a time here
to contemplate leaving?
I needed some time to think.
Well, I needed some time
to finalize our agreement with the Panamanians,
but instead I get dragged down here.
Yeah, I'm sure it was really hard
to convince you to come down here.
I'm gonna be honest.
I was looking forward to seeing you
dowI, uh, wouldn't wish this but now thaon anyone.
Can we just save all this till after...
I don't know if we can or not.
Made up your mind yet, Alex?
Eight years, minimum security.
I got 'em down to four.
And I leave for the US tonight?
Once the special
prosecutor clears you,
you'll be on your way.
What about a special prosecutor?
You stand in front of a guy,
you, you tell your story and he determines
if you're gonna be a useful and credible witness.
It's a formality.
"It's a formality"?
This is just a formality?
You know, if it were up to me,
you could rot in here for the rest of your life.
But the Justice Department
is extremely motivated to get to the bottom
of this President Reynolds business.
Alex, this is a hundred percent abovboard.
You've made a lot of mistakes in your career.
You know it and I know it,
intentional or otherwise.
I've got eight files in my office attesting to that.
And if you don't take this offer,
then I assure you it would be
the biggest mistake of your life.
I know who killed that man.
I'm sure you do.
What do we have here?
I found this
in Alexander Mahone's cell.
Convenient!
To blame this on a man who can't even be questioned.
Enough of this already. Cheo!
Get the prison up.
this time
You kno Whistler didn't do this.
He just said he found the shank in Mahone's cell?
Doesn't that prove I'm innocent?
You're a joke!
You talk about equality.
You talk justice, but at the end of the day
you're a dictator, and just like any dictator
you're terrified of losing your power.
It'd be very unwise to go any further.
You don't care who the real killer is
just as long as you get to string somebody up.
That's all that matters to you, isn't it?
I've determined who's guilty, and the punishment is death.
You're making a mistake. This is murder!
You know it and I know it!
At least have the guts to admit it!
You're right!
It's murder.
Don't!
I found this in the yar
Augusto used to give them to me as tribute.
And now you reek of them.
Go.
Everything okay?
It's sad...
one wrong move and a stranger
is throwing dirt on top of you.
He will be okay.
I question your love for your son.
He was two seconds away from being decapitated
because of you.
I told you the truth.
Maybe.
But if you have anything else planned,
now it's scrapped.
Because, what happens if you try something?
I know.
Oh, good.
This is the same newspaper she was holding in the last picture.
That's what my guy could get.
You didn't give me a lot of time.
You think Michael's not going to Nice this?
Yeah. "Hey, Michael, here's the pictures."
He's going to want to see this close up.
I'm done doing favors for you.
Get out.
I'll see you in an hour.
No football today?
No, no football today.
You're my brother, Sammy?
Of course.
It's done?
The guard will be asleep in a half hour.
So we're good.
Not quite.
They, uh, they know we're breaking out this afternoon.
You told her?
Man, she worked it out...
So what are we gonna do to get the upper hand here, Linc?
LJ and Sara? This is too dangerous.
If we try anything, they're just going to...
What, hurt them?
No, not if they want us to deliver on Whistler, they won't.
We're playing this one straight.
No games. No surprises.
All right?
Show me the pictures.
Show me the pictures, Linc.
Come on...
The pictures.
I can't show you the pictures, man.
Why not, Linc?
She's dead, Michael.
I lied to you.
I'm sorry.
If you don't break out today, they're going to kill my son.
They're going to kill LJ.
Michael, we've got to do this.
Michael, we've got to do this!
Sara's dead.
They killed her.
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
I loved her and... now she's go.
And it's all because of you.
What?
Hey, take it easy.
Wh... What?
This is your fault.
He's told me his grievance.
This fight is going to happen.
Just think about what you're doing.
I have.
Explain something to me, blanco,
One minute you plead for your friend's life,
and the next minute you nt to take it.
This man...
this man is no friend of mine!
Her name was Sara!
And she was a good person.
And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.
So it's revenge, eh, b?
An eye for an eye?
Once you make such a declaration there's no going back.
There's nothing to go back to.
Good.
Then we have a fight.
Now, both of you,
go and assign your belongings,
and pray to whatever god is yours.
Come back here in 15 minutes.
Fight, fight, fight, fight...
fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight fight...
You need anymore help?
You've done more than enough.
Here, take that, man.
It's not a lot, but it's enough to get you started.
Oh, no, no, I can't take this.
I did this because I wanted to help you guys.
Hey, buy a car, get a bus ticket,
do whatever, just get out of here.
Thanks.
I'm going to get so gas, okay?
I'll meet you in the front.
All right.
Good luck.
You too.
Is she coming with you to do the exchange?
Yeah.
You think that's a good idea?
I mean, what if something goes wrong
just in case Whistler doesn't want to go quietly.
You think any of this is going to go down quiet?
They're just going to give you LJ
just like that? Doesn't matter what I think.
I know what these people are capable of.
I'm not going to gamble with my son's life.
Maybe you don't have to.
Yeah.
We'll be arriving at the courthouse in about 15 minutes.
Then the hearing will begin shortly.
All and all this whole thing will be done within the hour.
Good.
That sounds good.
So with this deal...
what specifically are they expecting from me?
They need to knoeverything.
About the President, about the company.
They want to confirm that you have
viable incriminating information
and that you can be a cooperative witness.
If I cooperate fully...
I won't just be incriminating them.
You're worried about all those skeletons in your closet,
but you have full immunity.
Everything will be fine.
All you have to do is tell the truth.
Stay calm.
Better knuckle up.
Look, I don't know what you're thinking,
but killing me is not
I'm not going to kill you.
Then what the hell was all that about?!
You want to make it out of here without being seen,
you need a diversion. Now we have one.
You're off your head. Do you know that? They're waiting...
We don't have time for this. It's almost 3:00,
and that means the tower guard should be drugged by now.
At 3:13, the sun's going to hit the other guard tower.
We'll have the cover we need. It's now or never.
Listen, Michael, I, uh...
I meant what I said about Sara.
If I were you I wouldn'tention that name again.
We're getting out of here now, and then I'm trading you for my nephew.
And then I'm going to find out
who's responsible for taking her life...
and I'm taking theirs.
Listen, Scofield... Not now.
I just... please.
I heard you out there in the yard.
about Sara?
Yes.
That's not... I mean it's...
What'd she...?
I mean it.
She was a good person.
I'm sorry.
Is something wrong?
If anyone asks,
just tell them your fuel pump's leaking, all right?
No, no, no, I'm going to the beach with you.
No. I need you to keep a lookout.
When they get here I'll call you, all right?
If everything works out today,
you and me-- we're both going to get what we want.
Stay here.
Sorry about that.
That's okay.
I know you're just doing your job.
I bet you're as ready
for this t over with as I am.
Hey, you know, once we get out of Panama,
me and my dad and my uncle
we're going to open up a scuba shop somewhere.
go swimming every day.
I always wanted to, you know?
I get it.
You're a human being
wi dreams, plans for the future, all that.
Whether you see it isn't up to me anymore.
It's in your uncle's hands now.
So let's just hope that he does his job.
What are you waiting for?
He's gone.
What, just like that?
Why? I mean, how?
How about we worry a little bit more about us, huh?
You know, he got out of here kind of suddenly.
How do we know he's not ratting us out right now?
When did this happen?
I'll handle it.
Something wrong?
A couple of the Panamanians might have gotten cold feet.
Exactly how cold?
They just need some convincing.
It's nothing to worry about.
It's all gonna work out.
Meantime, we're gonna take you to a hotel room.
Up until an hour ago,
this was a done deal.
So... what's happening?
Relax. This is still your best bet.
Unless someone's offering you
a "get out of Sona free" card.
Now, remember, we'll only have four minutes of cover,
so once you hit the ground you run straight to the fence.
Don't look up, don't look back,
don't say a word.
What if they see us?
If someone yells stop,
you stop.
That's it?
That's it.
It's time.
Where's Sammy?
I dont know, Patron
So, who goes first?
Right now my life isn't worth a damn without yours.
If this doesn't go as planned, the first guy
through that window's gonna get shot.
That guy can't be you.
I'll go.
I got it.
Come on, come on, come on.
This is it.
Five...
four...
three...
two... one.
The glare.
Come on
This is it.
Someone's coming.
Good luck.
You, too.
We're losing the light.
Go back.  Go back!
Go back!
Come on! Come on!
That was our only chance.
Damn it!
Find out where they are.
Do you hear 'em out there? They're waiting for us.
The damn thing's not coming off!
Hey, gringos!
Come out and play.
Come on! Come on!
Nowhere to hide, malditos!
Gringos!
Come out and play!
We've got to go. They can't find us here.
But what about this?
Stash it!
Come on!
Come on!
. Go.
Where are you off to, Backra?
Where you boys been?
The bathroom?
This has all been
a terrible mistake.
Has it been?
We've, uh, we've worked it out.
There's no need to take this any further.
You clearly don't understand
I gave you every chance to pull out.
Please.
We know the rules!
Two men go in,
one man comes out!
Now,
this quarrel must be settled.
Let's go.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
What are you gentlemen waiting for?
You two don't make this more interesting, I will.
Sorry, mate-- if only one of us is getting out...
How's it look?
They got LJ in the back of the van.
All right, how many people they got?
She's got a driver and a bodyguard-- that's it.
All right. You know I appreciate you hanging around, man
Hey, we started this together, bro.
Let's finish it that way.
Where are you?
What you doing here?
You're supposed to be keeping watch.
Just checking, making sure everything is all right.
They're running a bit late, that's all.
So, what's the plan?
You gonna swim out, wait for the police to pass, and...
meet with a boat somewhere?
Something like that.
And then what?
You know what, you need to get back
I'm impressed.
You've actually got the guts to look me in the eye
as you stab me in the back.
What are you going to do, shoot me?
Don't. I can't let you hand over
James to those people.
You need to think about what you're doing.
I have!
Every since you told me what they did to Sara.
When they get here, James and I, we're leaving.
Where to?
I don't know. Somewhere they won't find us.
So, this whole time, you played me.
Like you've been playing me.
Bringing me here to be your lookout?
But it's okay.
We were both here doing what we had to
for the people we love.
You do this, you may as well be shooting my son yourself.
I'm sorry.
They should be out by now. Any sign?
All quiet.
How much longer do youant to give them?
I know you wanted to live
by an ocean your whole life.
Sad to think
the closest you'll get is being buried under one.
You're not gonna kill me.
You already killed Sara.
Anything happens to me,
you're out of bargaining chips.
If Michael doesn't get Whistler out today,
I won't need to bargain anymore.
You'll all be dead.
Hurtdo?Where you at?
Better send someone to check
on Hurtado in Tower One.
He is not answering his radio
and I don't have a visual.
Confirmed.
We'll send a couple men over.
Kick him in the junk, Scofield!
What are you looking for, boy! There are no draws here!
If this isn't finished by one of you,
I'm coming down to finish both of you.
What are you doing over there?
What, are you sleeping on the job?
No, I don't know what happened.
End it.
God! God forgive me.
They should have been here by now.
Maybe they get out. They should be on their way.
I don't care what you do,
but I'm taking the car.
What?
What the hell's going on?
Put your hands up on your head!
You come down here.
Now!
We are going to find out who is behind this.
What?
Were you going to let me know what the hell's going on?
I'm here.
Good. Where are they?
They're in the car with me.
I heard the alarm.
They were long gone before that thing went off.
Well, if they had such a head start,
why are you so far behind?
Listen, do you want me to talk to your drive?
I want you to put Whistler on the phone.
What?
Put him on.
He's in the trunk.
But, if you feel that strongly about it,
I can pull over and you two can have a Nice little talk.
If we're real lucky, maybe some cops will swing by.
I'm sure they'd like a word, too.
You know what? Just get LJ ready.
Whoever tried to escape assaulted one of my men.
And, as you know, any attempt on the life
of a Panamanian soldier
warrants the death penalty.
This attempt was made from cell #212.
And if memory serves,
that cell belongs to members of your crew, no?
You.
You are one of the Milkman's boys.
Is it your cell?
I'm going to take that as a yes.
I let you run your business, have your whores.
When you asked me for your own per Sona l supply of water
when the lumbing went down, did I not provide it?
When you asked me to get rid
of the phones, make them contraband,
so you could control the trade in here,
did I not comply?
I do all this for you.
And in exchange, you were to do one thing
for me.
Keep these men in line!
Maybe we just backed the wrong horse.
Perhaps there is another in here better suited for the job.
Good luck, Bredda.
You know none of us tried
to break out of that cell.
I do.
Then you must know there's only one guy here
foolish enough to try.
Nice to see you back in form.
Thanks.
Any news from Sullins?
He's working on it.
It doesn't matter what people say.
What do they say?
The men, the ones they say you killed.
Is it true?
Because, if it is, you can talk to about it.
Is that a fact?
Yes. You can trust me.
So let me get this straight.
Sullins sends you to be good cop?
That's not what this is.
Sullins just wants me to confess
The deal is legit.
The hearing was supposed to be
So why don't you just come clean, Felicia, huh?
For old times' sake? How about it?
I can smell the stuff a mile away.
Don't you accuse me of being the one who's hiding something.
Hey, I just got confirmation from the radio.
No one made it out of there today.
Sucre, what's going on?
Looks like they're packing up.
Whatever you do
don't let them take LJ, all right?
Get the hell out of here now.
Look out!
Dad!
Let her go
Drop it or I swear to God I'll put a bullet in her head!
Now you let him go! You let him go now! Dad!
LJ, I'm going to get you out of this, I promise.
You sure you want to make promises to your son you can't keep?
Watch your mouth.
I'll let you in on a little secret.
When you choose
this line of work, you know it's all going to come down
to a moment like this.
So kill me.
Let him go.
Dad!
So put your gun down, Linc.
Kill him.
Dad!
No!
No
Give me one more shot.
To do what?
Let me find out what happened in Sona.
We can make this happen.
Put him in the van.
You all right?
What happened?
Body bags.
All right then.
Right, just so you know,
I wouldn't have gone through with it.
Lucky for us, we'll never have to find out.
So what do we do now?
You know where are you, boy?
your mother had a little bit too much to drink one night
Keep talking
How you want it, brother?
Fast or slow?
ke to handle this one myself.
Do you have children, Mr. Scofield?
Maybe someday.
Three boys, two girls.
Now I used to tell them a story--
I believe in your country
they call it, "The Boy Who Cried Wolf."
You know it?
Well, then you know the moral of that story
is even when liars tell the truth,
they can never be believed.
But your life's on the line, boy.
Are you trying to break out of this prison, Mr. Scofield?
No.
Are you trying to break out of this prison?
We both know that's not possible.
I want you to tell me the truth. I want to hear it.
I have good reason to kill you.
Because of you, it's no longer possible
for me to effectively govern this prison.
Justified or not,
the men no longer ha faith in me.
That leaves only one thing for me to do
to guarantee my survival.
You are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield.
And you're taking me with you.
Well, I've got some good news
and I've got some better news.
Let's start with the good.
Panamanians are back on board.
And the better news?
You're going to get to have
a really Nice sleep on that bed.
I thought that I...
After the hearing I was going to be on a plane back to the U.S.
You said...
I did, and you will be,
but it's just too late to do the hearing now.
We'll get to it first thing tomorrow.
Please... is there something, is there anything
that we can do to help speed things up?
When a genie grants you a wish
you don't really tell him to make it snappy.
This hearing
needs to happen today.
The hearing needs... needs to happen right now!
Listen to you.
You know, you are unbelievable.
I have dropped everything
to come down her
and drag your sorry ass
I can't wait.
You know, I am so glad
I have made this trip
to help your esteemed colleague.
I am just tickled.
Cuff him.
Is that necessary?
Cuff him.
I'm sorry.
I can't wait.
Hey, have you seen Whistler?
No.
I spent my whole career
trying to keep bad people behind bars.
Like somehow by doing my job
I was making the world a better place.
And then...
then you hear about what happened to someone like Sara.
Damn if it doesn't seem like there's more bad people
out there than in here.
I warned the brothers what would happen if they failed.
If I give them more time now, I may as well hand them
a condom and a cigarette to go with it.
You know, I came all the way down here.
The least you could do is offer me an opinion.
I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.
And I thought you needed to be out in seven days.
I need to know how this delay is going to affect things.
Well, it won't be comfortable, but it will be possible.
Oh, well, thank you, James,
but that doesn't exactly ravage me with confidence.
And what would?
Your ass on a plane.
Four more days.
If I'm out of here by then, I can still do it.
Trust me. It'll be fine.
I'll let the brothers know.
She's fine.
Burrows is taking real good care of her.
Previously on Prison Break
We're losing the light! Go back!
You.
Is it your c El l?
You are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofi El d.
And you're taking me with you.
So with this deal
Show me the pictures.
I can't show you the pictures, man.
She's dead, Micha El .
I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.
I need to know how this d El ay is going to affect things.
four more days
If I'm out of here by then
I'll let the brothers know.
You like this?
Yeah.
It's a special occasion.
My dad's coming today,
so I'm just gonna wait here till he shows up.
You look sharp.
Thanks.
Scofi El d , you have a vistor
Giving us four more days.
Okay, good.
Listen, back at the exchange point,
I saw three body bags.
You, me and LJ,
we weren't getting out of there alive.
That's the last time I get caught flatfooted.
Then do what you got to do, Linc.
As long as I take care of my end, right?
You lied.
toI  lie.
Your son is my nephew,
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.
But apparently...
apparently you only think I only care about mys El f.
I know you don't care about yours El f,
but you cared about Sara.
You loved her.
And I'm sorry.
But LJ's my son.
I-I couldn't let anything happen to him.
You know that
You used me, Linc.
So I guess you and the Company have something in common.
I don't know where he is.
I have tried every number I have.
Listen I will check back in headquarters
and see what they say.
Never mind.
I found him.
You always had such
high-end taste for a girl from Whe El ing.
Since I paid for it...
It was a mess before I got here.
And it's time to clean it up.
We're ending this today.
General, that was analyzed.
What you're asking for
is too dangerous, not to mention
next to impossible with the given time frame.
I remember
a substantial wire transfer to an offshore accoun
that took the word "impossible"
out of the equation-- or t El l me,
did I hire the wrong person?
I am doing my job when I t El l you to siously reconsider.
And now, I have to do my job.
I don't pay you to be my advisor.
You're my operative.
You have your instructions, now get it done.
Beuse if you don't,
fe El like a massage.
This was a big mistake, Gretchen.
You can't make a habit of coming to Sona.
I won't.
Because we're going with the bang anbud .
That's suicide.
We have more time.
My boss wants things to move a bit faster.
W El l, t El l him you can't pull it off.
I might get killed if we do this.
And I might get killed if we don't.
Between you and me,
who do you think I care about more?
Look at me, James.
See if you can t El l how serious I am.
If you don't play ball,
I will leave you in Sona to rot.
I promise.
Be ready by 5:00.
That's when it hpens.
Everybody goes.
What about Scofi El d?
Kill him.
The military's reinforcing the bars on all the windows.
Can you talk to the colon El ,
get him to postpone that for a few days? .
After your performance yesterday,
I have no further sway with the colonel .
Wel l, then I'm afraid you've brokered your way
into an escape plan that no longer exists.
I have an idea.
Wait to hear from me.
What?
Some of the men don't feel the need to pay their debts anymore.
It's been one week, man,
and we lost three men.
Now, if we gonna keep Sona, we're gonna need numbers.
I don't trust nobody here righnot  especially now.
I work with the men I have.
Really, brother?
You, me
and the gimp over there, we gonna run this place?
I want to bring on Cristobal.
He's solid, man.
One of them Darrien ghetto boys.
Bring him up.
But I promise you nothing.
Find me anything that can sustain heavy RPGs
and small arms.
A Cougar, a Stryker.
Not gonna happen.
I do have a call in to a Sergeant York, but...
Yeah, that's not going to cut it.
Call Suezamel , put him on standby,
tel l him we might need him.
Is there a problem?
We're doing this at 5:00?
weWe could wait until tonight
when our guys are moving too fast
for our night vision to work properly.
You could even tag along if you want.
Get it done.
Escape Atrevido Disuel to
Hel lo.
Yes, I'm trying to locate the family of Mr. James Whistler.
I-I am his-- I'm his wife.
Who's calling?
I own the apartment building Mr. Whistler rents from.
There's been a busted pipe in his unit that's caused
some damage to the apartment next door.
I'm sorry.
I think you have confused James with someoneel se.
He's not renting another apartment.
Oh, I assure you Mr. Whistler is my tenant.
I couldn't find anyone to contact after his conviction,
but when the mail came, I checked his phone bill.
There were numerous calls to this number.
If you could please come to the apartment,
the address is 40 Ab El Bravo in Obarrio,
Unit 4.
T El l your men the int El says
the Panamanians have no access to SAM.
Yeah.
There's been a dev El opment.
The Company's giving us four more days.
I, uh, I don't know how we're getting out of here.
Lechero might have some ideas, but I'm still waiting
to hear from him.
I'm sorry, is this a bad time for you?
It's been an intense 24 hours.
I have things on my mind.
Yeah, like your last trip to visitation maybe.
What, you're a spy now?
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but she didn't really strike me
as the girlfriend type.
She was Company.
After your failed escape, she came to remind me
that I have a stake in this, too,
which you seem to have forgotten.
So forgive me if I don't jump for joy
when you say you're working on a plan
that may very w El l fail again.
I've got to get out of here,
and it's getting to the point where I don't care how.
Got what we talked about?
You never met me.
Oh, my God.
What the h El l is going on?
He... raped, killed, tortured.
I couldn't turn, turn him over
to some scumbag lawyer who was just gonna get him off or...
or... no, no, I just...
so I killed him.
And I f El t... good.
I f El t, I f El t really good.
of Shales begging for his life,
and I couldn't get rid of them,
so I, I got these drugs that kept me on an even ke El .
And then when I got to Sona,
I coul get my pills, so I had to...
improvise.
Did you want me to get drugs for you?
I assume that whoever set this up must think
that I might have some value.
It's why you came back for me.
I came here to h El p a man that I respect and care about.
And I appreciate that.
But I can't testify like this.
Please...
Please...
One inch of reinforced ste El on every window.se.
Nothing would get through those.
I'll figure something out.
I know you will.
Listen, man, I'm sorry about before.
Like I said, things have been intense.
So much depends on this working out.
My nephew's life depends on this working.
I know it does.
I never asked-- how old is he?
Sixteen.
Oh, h El l.
What do you want?
Me? I just came by to slip something
into your mail slot.
It's from El Patron hims El f,
but it was made for your eyes only.
Grabby.
That don't look like no invitation
to the Sona-Hains Dance.
What do you got cooking up with Lechero, huh?
It's none of your business, Theodore.
You want to keep secrets?
You want to treat me like a pesky insect? Fine.
Just remember, information, like crumbs,
always trickles down to the vermin on the floor.
It's a sketch of Lechero's quarters.
To be honest, when a tenant pays a year's rent in advance
and then gets locked up,
I normally rent the place out
and double my money, but, uh,
James was a good man.
I was hoping things would turn out w El l for him.
Look, uh, miss...
a lot of guys have a little something on the side.
This apartment, I mean, whoever he brought here,
You said you have James' insurance paper?
Right on. Right on.
I'll, uh, I'll go get them.
Oh, God.
There's another door in here.
4413, huh?
What about Scofi El d?
Kill him.
You know, if Lechero didn't send this,
T-Bag might be setting me up for someone.
I say we get out of here.
I'm truly rrsoyou got caught up in my troubles, Micha El .
I take it there's another code.
I'm the only one that knows it.
For a man who likes keeping a secret,
choosing T-Bag as a go-bween
might not be the smartest move.
Yeah, by the time he figures it out, we'll be long gone.
Sammy's on his way back. Let's go.
What the h El l's this?
Underground tunn El .
The old administration used it
to trav El between c El lblocks A and B.
After the riots, they moved us all to B.
And then the soldiers came in,
blew this tunn El up.
Looks like someone already tried to get through the debris.
I never planned to spend my whole life in Sona.
Just didn't expect it to end so soon.
You're the engineer, though, right?
You can dig our way out of this?
Yeah, me and a couple of payloaders.
Now, you listen.
You're gonna dig out of this place.
We're not digging out, but we might be diggin up.
H El lo, Sofia.
H El lo. Who are you?
Friend of James.
Old friend.
W El l, he isn't here.
I know where he is.
I can see why James loves you.
You arebeautiful.
it doesn't b El ong,
I'm gonna make him miss you very, very much.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
Good.
You don't need to worry about this.
Now listen very carefully to me, Sofia, and you won't get hurt.
I want you to go home ando your hair
and paint your nails and get all ready
for when James comes home.
You two will live happily ever after.
What do you want from him?
See? You're not listening already.
Don't get in the way,
or I promise you things will get very bad for you.
You are truly beautiful.
I hope you can stay that way.
Get the h El l out of rehe
All right, if we can get through
the ceiling, the foundation and the earth on top othat,
we can make it out into the middle of no-man's-land
and maybe hit the fence before we get shot.
Yeah. W El l, we wouldn't want that.
Yes, but you can dig out, though, right?
Or...
Or what?
The whole thing collapses and we're buried alive.
Go on and r El ax, huh?
I'll get some rum.
Maybe two days.
I got to get upstairs, estimate exactly where
Just getng rum for Cristobal and his boys.
Rum?! His boys?!
No, I said I'd meet with Cristobal,
not every half-breed in Sona.
W El l, they up there right now.
So, let's go.
Let me just get some rum, now. No, man.
Them drink beer like everyone El se.
Look, man, offer them something good.
Don't make me lookhe fool.
The rum is for me, Sammy.
No?
You have a problem with that?
No, sir.
Good.
Let's go.
Let's get back to work.
Hey, only Lechero has the code.
We don't need a code.
Now, get inside
before Sammy comes back.
Where's Agent Lang?
Agent... I don't know.
But what the h El l's wrong with you? What's going on?
I have a right to be nervous.
My life is on the line, you know?
What are you talking about?
You have given live press conferences your entire life.
I've see you many times. You're an old pro.
Now, splash some water on your face.
The pan El wants us there right now, immediat El y.
What? Get dressed.
Or would you rather have me
drag your ass back to Sona?
Water on the face. Get your suit on. We're going.
Uh, we're almost ready to move here.
Where the h El l is Lang?
No.
Where are we at?
Everything's in place.
Good. We've done our part.
Now it's time for Whistler to step up and do his.
Come 5:00, he tter be ready.
Three feet of concrete and rebar,
plus ten feet of dirt and sand,
before we see sky.
Are you all right?
To be complet El y honest...
no,
not really.
I have this thing for, uh, confined spaces.
Are you t El ling me you're claustrophobic?
Ever since I was a...
boy.
Um, you know, I need to be upstairs.
That's not really an option right now.
W El l, staying here is not really an option for me, either.
I suggest you get yours El f togetr.
I just need some air.
What the h El l's the matter with you?
I need to get out of here; I need air. Hey, you walk
through that door with Sammy on the other side,
you'll never need air again.
You don't understand-- I need to get out of here now.
Why don't you t El l me wh really going on here, Whistler?
Why do you keep looking at your watch?
What are you really up to?
Scofi El d, the men are gone-- let's move.
I need your c El l phone.
No, Sammy's on his way-- get out of here.
I have to call my brother. No, c El l phone stays with me. Now,
get out of here!
W El l, just so that we're clear, Americano,
she's got no El ectricity and no running water.
Septic's out, too, but there's an outhouse in the woods.
It's perfect. A hundred bucks a month. $200.
A hundred bucks a month.
Deal.
But I don't want growing no drugs on the land.
No mari Juan a.
You got that?
W El come home, my friend. Thanks.
Listen, man, if you want
to get out of here, I'd get it and Micha El would, too.
You've done more than enough. If I had a kid
in the same situation as your son,
would you and your brother walk out on me?
Yeah.
Here, this is good.
Put it down there.
Okay, hold on.
You ready?
Yeah.
I hope this works, papi.
All right, let's go.
I need your h El p.
Not now, bro-- my father finally got here; I'm gonna go see him.
Actually, uh, I need his h El p, too.
What you want from my old man?
I just need someone to d El iver
a message on the outside, someone I can trust.
H El l, no. My papa's straight as razor blade.
He don't get into kind of trouble like you do.
It's not trouble-- it's just a phone call. No.
I love my father.
And I love my brother-- and if he doesn't
get this message, something horrible's gonna happen to him.
Something really bad is going on.
Please.
H El lo, son.
Papa.
You look very handsome.
Like your school picture.
Gracias.
I cleaned a guy's c El l for this shirt.
You should be in school now...
It's okay, Papa. with your friends.
Papa, please, don't get upset.
I-I have friends in here.
The American?
Yes. He's Nice .
And, uh...
he needs my h El p.
Thank God you're here.
Thought you might have come a little earlier,
just to make sure I was okay.
I read the newspaper; I knew you were safe.
I am for now-- but you might not be.
Now, listen to me carefully.
Promise me you won't go anywhere near Lincoln Burrows today.
to be around him, to be with him, to be near him.
Just go home and stay there,
and I will call you tonight.
That's all I can say.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Promise me.
Say it out loud.
I promise.
Why are you so scared?
Because I can't have you get hurt.
Because I love you... more than anything in the world.
Do you?
Yeah.
I got a ca today
from a man who said he's your landlord.
Talking about another apartment.
Should I call him back?
Must have been a wrong number.
He asked for you by name.
The man is clearly confused.
I don't know anything about another apartment.
all I know is that you've got to stay away from Lincoln.
Please.
Okay, James.
I'll wait for your call.
Here.
I have this.
I don't want to see it.
I'll... put it with the others.
I'm not coming home.
Accept that.
You should go.
Make that call for my friend.
Happy birthday, son.
Maybe we should pick up some locks
The place needs to look abandoned.
Yeah?
I have a message for you.
Don't come home for dinner.
Who is this?
I'm supposed to t El l you,
don't come home for dinner.
What?
When me and Mikey were kids,
we had a code when Social Services
were trying to get me into juvie.
He's t El ling me to watch my back.
What the h El l are you doing here?
Why haven't you returned my calls or my car?
You have him?
Yeah, he just arrived back at his hot El .
But Whistler's girl tracked him down.
And she's talking
to Lincoln and the Mexican.
You have a directive?
I warned her.
Take them all out.
What will  say?
I said take them all out
I don't care about your boyfriend's apartment
on the side, I just don't care.
No, I went there.
And a woman showed up;
she threatened me.
She knows James.
You know her?
She's the one who has LJ.
W El l, she took something I found,
a passport.
It had James' picture and birthday
but his name said Gary Miller.
Lincoln, I don't know what's going on.
I'll t El l you what's going on--
your boyfriend's a liar
I told you that from the start.
James told me to stay away from you today,
that it was dangerous.
Let's go.
Pronto.
I'm his brother.
How you get this number?
He called  a few days back.
I-I didn't answer.
But, listen, I-I need to speak to him now.
Let's go.
You'll never guess Micha El Scofi El d's brother.
Who calls me...
and who I call,
is my business.
Where are your friends?
I don't know.
Where are your f?ri
I don't know, Please don't shoot. Please.
Drop it.
Why are you coming after this?
Different day, same problem, huh, Lincoln?
You know how it turned out when LJ was in this position,
y is no different...
so be a good boy and put down the gun.
Come on, Linc.
I know you've learned your lesson.
You're right, I have.
For the record,
this is an international hearing,
requested by the United States government,
for the purpose of hearing testimony from one
Mr. Alexander Mahone.
You gotta be kidding me.
So, Mr. Mahone,
when were you first contacted by anyone
from the group referred to the Company?
They told me...
that if I didn't kill every one of the Fox River Eight,
that they would come after me.
They had all worked with-with Scofiel d
on-on-on the escape,
so the Company wasn't sure what they knew.
Mr. Mahone, I'm going to ask you
to please keep your answer rel ated to the question.
It's-it's all connected.
It's just... it's-it's a web.
And-and it's a web that I got caught in.
And-and Lincoln Burrows got caught in,
I, if I may,
I think what Mr. Mahone...
We're all just like flies... was trying to say...
Thank you, Mr. Sullins,
but we're here to hear from Mr. Mahone.
Now, we're going to try this again.
When were you first contacted
by the Company?
I cannot say.
You know...
they could be in contact with you or-or-or...
you could be in contact with them, you'd never know.
It's-it's... they could be in contact with us right now.
I know...
it sounds crazy, right?
It's craz... and...
and it would be, except for the simple fact that...
It's true.
The government that I had dedicated my life to
Manipulate and extorted me.
Blackmailed me.
So that I would kill for them.
And I did the things that they made me do
so I could protect my family.
And so...
I would like to go home.
So can Ithat, please?
Where have you been?
I came looking
for scrap metal for the support brace for the tunnel .
Really?
Looks like a pretty tight squeeze up there.
You sure there's enough fresh air,
or does the claustrophobia come and go?
What's it like going through life always distrustful?
You tel l me, James.
Hate to break up the brouhaha, gentlemen,
but Lechero would like to see you.
Says it has something to do with your big brotr.
Give us a moment, will you, Teodoro?
If your brother should ever call my cel l phone again,
you tel l him you're the one that's gonna pay.
Yeah?
You got the message. Yeah, you were right.
They just tried to take us out.
I know.
Whistler got a visit from the Company.
He's been acting strange ever since.
I'm tel ling you, Linc, something's up.
Doing more than acting strange, man.
He just told Sofia not to be
near me 'cause it's dangerous.
The Company's coming after us.
They don't need us anymore.
Here we go.
They're breaking him out on their own.
We're 100 yards from the target.
Keep your eyes open. Let's get in and out fast.
Come on!
Damn!
Come on!
Come on! Keep it coming!
Come on! Hey!
I've got a hel icopter and two inmates.
I can't make out their faces, but they're on the roof!
Come on!
Can't get a clean shot!
I'll get lower, take 'em out!
Is that Scofiel d on the roof with Whistler?
Is that really a question?
He's supposed to be dead.
Man down. Man down.
Let go! I'm slipping.
We lost Whistler. Abort. Abort.
Mission failure.
Return to Base One immediatel y.
I'm so sorry.
I'm going to have to take you back to Sona.
You, get up.
Vamos!
there have been two escape attempts in the past two days.
Somehow I don't think it's a coincidence
that you arrived shortly before they happened.
I d hathing to do with that.
You've caused too many problems here in Sona,
so maybe you shouldn't be here in Sona.
Get him out.
Say good-bye to Sona, Mr. Scofield.
Previously on prison break.
Sona's a one-way street.
What goes in... never comes out.
They got me and sara.
Lj and sara will be traded for whistler.
Are we clear?
I'll tell you the plan when you tell me who you are.
I'm a fisherman.
Really?
My life is in your hands.
How's lj? How's sara?
She's dead,michael.
I lied to you.
sofia lugo
i'm james whistler's girlfriend
You are breaking out of this prison,Mr. Scofield,
and you're taking me with you.
Four more days.
If I'm out of here by then,I can still do it.
There have been two escape attempts in the past two days.
Say good-bye to sona,Mr. Scofield.
right there,leave us
My predecessor,colonel escamilla,wasn't an effective leader.
He's been replaced.
I am general zavala.
Sit.
A drink of water?
With all due respect,general,I had nothing to do with what happened here today.
I always conduct a thorough investigation,
and there are too many unanswered questions here.
It is my job to find those answers.
If you help me do my job,I'll help you.
The helicopters.
You alone couldn't be responsible for that.
- You certainly weren't flying a helicopter,were you? - No.
- Who was? - I don't know.
- But you know who sent them. - No.
Again,be advised-- telling the truth is in your best interest.
I am.
Let's go for a walk.
I understand your fears,
but the republic of panama cannot allow this sort of activity.
If you wish to talk,now is the time.
I would... if there was anything left to say.
Then you give me no choice.
this way
This isn't good.
They're putting him in the hot box.
Things are gonna get much harder for you.
There's no way to win.
You must cooperate.
Confess to this escape and face your punishment by law,
or face a far greater punishment in the panama sun.
It's up to you.
He's done.
He's finished.
I hope my brother's all right.
Does it hurt?
It's fine.
I'm gonna get to the prison.
I was watching the news in the waiting room.
They identified a few bodies,but... it wasn't them.
I'll find out when I get there.
You want to come?
I don't,i don't know.
After everything that's happened,I don't know what to think anymore.
What more is there to think about?
James has an answer for everything,and nothing ever makes sense.
You need to stop asking questions and just look at the facts.
I wanted to believe everything he was saying,
and I still want him to get out.
I want him out as well.
Trust me,I've been working on this every single day.
Lincoln,I really appreciate everything you have done.
You saved my life.
You didn't have to help me like that.
Yeah. I did.
Get in the car.
come on
Everywhere I go,there you are.
Go home,sofia.
Part of me wanted to drive right past this gate,alex.
You don't deserve to be here.
Actually,if you take all things into consideration... I do.
Thank you.
Wait.
Don'T.
My father worked in a mine for 30 years,
he took this into work with him every day.
Kept him safe till the day he retired.
Then he gave it to me.
I can't take this.
Give it back when you get out.
Take care of yourself,alex.
Yeah.
what? You ain't got the guts to do it yourself?
Hey.
This is for you,so shut up before I change my mind.
After yesterday,you may be doubting my ability to make good on our agreement.
I need to keep you motivated.
You have one minute.
Dad!
Lj. Lj,thank god you're alive.
No,forget about it. There's nothing you can do.
- There's always something. - No,dad.
These guys are thorough.
They follow you everywhere.
Trust me.
That bitch is crazy.
She cut sara's head off.
I was there.
I closed my eyes,but I heard it.
You listen to me.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you,all right?
The next time you see me,don't take your eyes off me.
I'll tell you what to do. All right?
Minute's up.
Me and your uncle,we know what we're doing.
We're gonna get you out of this.
- I love you. - I love you,dad.
Looks like things didn't go so well.
You should be gone.
So should you.
What happened?
It's still happening.
I feel bad for michael,but we have a way without him.
You should get some rest.
What's the way?
I'll rest. I'll rest. I'll rest when I'm out.
I won't go without you.
You have my word.
Now get some rest.
You see scofield out in that redneck sauna?
Let's see if he has the tattoo to get out of that one.
You were in on it,right?
I see you guys lurking around lechero.
Scofield's gotta have a plan to escape.
If so,I know none of it.
Yeah,I bet you don'T.
Too many cocktails out on the lido deck.
Here comes trouble.
Se�or criada,clean it up.
Yeah,I'll get right on that.
You heard what I said.
I told you to do something.
Now do it.
Cleaning up chunks ain't in my job description anymore.
Oh,things changed.
You see,you answer to us now.
Hey,caveman,you don't scare me.
Go bug someone else.
Jorge!
what are you doing here?
I have a special delivery.
I need to get it in real quick.
How much?
I gave you ten grand.
Ten grand was the last one. How much for this one?
no grand.
Then no thanks.
i think you might...
...want to reconsider
Take this water to the prisoner.
Why should I? He doesn't deserve it.
I'll do it.
Hi,brother.
Remember me?
This isn't gonna work.
Come on,papi,drink this.
Don't let anything happen to lj,okay?
It's okay.
He's doing much better than you.
Come on. Drink this. You need it.
I'm sorry about sara.
I'm gonna try to sneak more into the prison next time,okay?
I want you to quit.
I can'T.
We all have to quit sometime.
No,michael.
You're here in a chicken coop-- you need all the help you can get.
Don't need your help. Just go,and don't look back.
Not after everything you've done for me.
****go
So you tried to catch a flight out of here yesterday?
I had to do what I had to do.
Yeah,but you went back on our deal.
I was saving my own ass.
I'm sure you're familiar with the strategy.
Now,you watch it.
I'm still boss here.
Who cares about who's boss?
Do you want to get out of here,or do you want to keep talking about it?
It's okay.
We just need to brace it.
No. We need the engineer.
Move it.
Let's get out of here before sammy gets back.
98 degrees in the shade,125 in the box.
Let's go inside.
We'll have a chat in the air conditioning.
Tomorrow is going to be hotter,the next day,even hotter.
The day after that,you'll be dead.
You don't understand.
If I thought you could help me...
I can.
You're unaware of the influence I have in this province.
You'd rather I be your ally than your enemy,wouldn't you?
You n't know these people.
We can't stop them-- not you,not me.
There was a man-- a drug kingpin-- the most powerful man in panama.
A ruthless killer with an army of thugs and thieves behind him.
He killed judges and policemen,anyone who stood in his way.
They said he couldn't be stopped either,
but now lechero is in prison,and I'm in power.
I decide whose life is at stake,and right now,it is yours.
From the moment I got here...
I've been planning my escape.
He's talking.
How do you know?
You can't get out of the box any other way.
the people who sent the helicopters,
they're the same people who framed my brother back in the U.S.,
The same people who wanted me here in sona.
In order for you to break out another inmate?
Yes.
Who are these people?
I don't know,but they have my brother's son.
They like to keep collateral.
I could be putting his life in danger as we speak.
If what you told me is true...
...you would be saving him.
I would call my troops and order a search for the boy immediately.
But this story... it's fiction.
It's true.
It's what you wanted. It's the only thing I have left to give.
Please.
His name is lj.
He's only 16 years old.
What's that smell?
Armandos.
These things cost money.
Somebody gave them to me-- i don't even smoke those things.
Who?
This guy i ran some stuff into the prison for,man.
You ran some stuff into the prison? Like what? Drugs?
I don't know. Who cares? He paid me.
You should have quit that job,I...
I know,okay?I need some cash for my kid.
Maricruz doesn't have insurance,all right?
Listen. I... I just saw michael.
He's in solitary confinement.
What?
They put him in a box out in the middle of the yard,all by himself.
He can't do anything.
It's going to be okay.
It's not going to be okay.
I don't know what to do,man.
Everything's just fallen apart.
What you lookin' at?
The view.
I can't help but notice you and lechero made friends.
He's been hanging out with a lot of white boys lately.
Got a problem with that?
No. But sammy does.
See,i've been looking close,like I always do.
And I know you all would be a lot better off if sammy were no longer around.
Wouldn't have to worry about his snout poking in your business.
And you're suggesting...?
You and I both know it needs to happen.
There aren't many men in sona who would take out sammy.
I have one particular man in mind.
A man who owes me.
But if I pull through,I'm in the club,guaranteed.
You're gonna see to it.
***
I assume you have the power to make this deal.
I do. Agreed.
Right.
Well. Thank you,sir.
Look,I've been thinking about what you told me and,
uh... but I can't quit my job.
Do whatever you want to do.
Well,I would if you could kick me a few bucks,you know.
Are we gonna do this again? I told you.
I don't have any cash.
What do you expect me to do?
Do whatever you want.
You could use my help,right?
You're gonna start charging me now for your friendship?
I got a kion the way!
And I got a kid I may never see again.
Yeah,get me gretchen.
Much to my surprise,there seems to be some degree of truth to your tale.
Everything I told you is true.
That's for me to determine.
What more can I say?
This inmate.
The one who you've been sent to free.
He should be able to verify what you've told me.
He should but... I don't know if he will.
Tell me his name.
These people won't hesitate to kill my nephew.
I need to know you're gonna do everything you can to find him.
I will,but I need a name.
I need your word.
You have it.
I'll find the boy.
Now,the name.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Why don't you tell me?
I went to that apartment,your apartment.
And this woman showed up like she knew you.
And then I found a passport.
Who's gary miller?
That apartment,that passport,it's all for us.
It's how we're gonna get away.
When I get out of this place,I'll be working on a way for us to be together.
Remember how we always talked about france?
Oh,james.
Yeah.
Our plan to be together.
James,how... how can I believe you?
How can I believe anything anymore?
Whistler.
**
And just know,just know that I love you.
You're facing some serious charges.
Michael scofield told me there are some people out there who are very determined to get you out of here.
What's he talking about?
You know nothing about this?
No.
Scofield's a smart man but,uh,he's got a rabid imagination.
So you're calling him a liar?
More or less.
I've been able to verify the story.
I already know everything,Mr. Whistler,in detail.
I just need a name.
Who's in charge on the outside?
We can end this right now if you can provide it.
What are you talking about?
****
****
What's going on here?
Gracias.
Now,start over.
There you are.
And here I am,without my bag of goodies.
I was afraid you were gone for good.
Party would not be the same without you.
I'm glad you're back,cause I need a favor.
It involves you,a chicken foot and a man who's got it comin'.
What man?
Sammy.
Now,you get well,and you get him out there in that ring,
and you do that one,that... neck thing.
In exchange,I'm gonna cover all your medical expenses.
I'll tell you what. You take your time.
I'm gonna go get my bag right now,put you out of this misery.
You're the best cock in the fight,alex.
Please don't let me down.
Maybe now you'll feel more comfortable telling me the truth.
Are you working with scofield?
- Are you working with scofield?! - Yes! Yes,I'm working with scofield.
But there's no one else involved.
As they say in america,we're gonna get this story straight.
I told him the truth.
I suggest you do the same.
I have.
He's confirmed nothing!
Ask him about that woman he's been meeting with.
Huh?
That's not what you think.
Doesn't matter what I think; it matters what you know, and you know her name.
And the fact that he won't admit it tells me that he's no innocent bystander in this.
You know I am.
Prove it.
'Cause that's the only way we're getting out of here.
Michael, this is suicide-- they'll kill sofia.
And they'll kill your brother's son.
This is the man who can help us, and he can't do anything without a name, so tell him!
James... we don't have a choice.
It's over.
Gretchen morgan.
I don't know where she lives, I don't know how you find her.
That's all I know, her name.
Gretchen morgan.
Two more of those, please.
I'm gonna get going.
No, he'll stay.
Relax... fernando, is it?
I just want to talk a minute.
Alone.
This right here is as alone as we're gonna get.
I heard about your argument with lincoln.
you people are everywhere, huh?
Now, you know him better than i do, but from personal experience,
burrows can be hard to handle.
That man does not like to be told what to do.
He sure likes bossing everyone else around.
You have to start looking out for yourself, fernando.
Level the playing field.
All you have to do is go back, apologize, tell him that you'll stay on a few more days for free.
And tomorrow or the day after, I'll call you, and you'll meet me for a drink.
In exchange, I'll pay.
50 grand.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not asking you to do anything that doesn't help everyone in the long run.
I don't see how this is helping.
Lincoln causes as many problems as he solves.
He needs to get out of his own way, and I think you can assist him.
I stay one step ahead, and you get 50 grand.
I don't know.
I think you do.
Where do I find this gretchen morgan?
She's somewhere here in panama city.
Aw, that's not much help in a city of a million people.
It could take days, weeks.
I've told you.
I only know her name.
- I have no idea. - I do.
But I'll need to use your phone.
- linc. - Michael!
What phone are you on?
Just listen to me.
I need to know where and when your next meeting with susan b is.
Garfield-price building downtown in an hour. Why?
Garfield-price, one hour.
- Can you give her a message for me? - Yeah.
Tell her everything is going as planned.
What the hell's going on, michael?
Just give her the message, linc.
I'll see you soon.
You should have listened.
Are you going to throw down a chicken foot over a puddle of puke?
You should have mopped.
Stumpy, wait your turn, man.
Excuse me.
I wanted to see patr�n lechero, por favor.
What you want to see him about?
I got one ofhese from him, and I didn't do nothing.
He don't listen.
The fight goes on as planned-- after we eat lunch.
Sammy.
- You issue a fight? - Yeah.
What about it?
It's not your right.
It's not your place.
Well, maybe it should be.
general: She's arrived?
I'm on my way.
You'd better be right.
What happened?
It worked.
- It did? - Yeah.
She came up to me just like you said and offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back.
So we stick with the plan, right?
- Yeah. - Cool.
I'm going to see her right now.
it's okay.
I came back for you.
Come on, now, everything's gonna be okay.
You can't deprive yourself like this.
G-get out of here.
You don't mean that.
Yeah... yeah, I do. I do.
Talk straight.
You're not talking straight.
Withdrawals are the worst way to die.
You're going to shake, and you'll sweat until you evaporate into nothing.
It's a long bumpy road to hell.
Is that what you want, alex? Or do you wanna live?
See you on the other side.
when you're up all night...
with diarrhea running down both your legs and vomit is in your hair...
...don't come crawling back.
It's been a long day.
Let's just get this over with.
I got a message from my brother.
Everything is going ahead as planned.
Really?
I would think you'd be facing a major setback.
You know michael.
Always has things worked out.
No, I don'T.
Seems to me he keeps screwing things up.
He's getting things done a whole lot faster than you.
Whistler's out by tomorrow, all right?
Zavala: Gretchen morgan?
Yes.
General zavala, panamanian national police.
Come with us, please.
- Why?What's this all about? - Llevenla.
No, I don't understand. I don't understand.Wait!
I had nothing to do with this.
I had nothing to do with this!Nothing!
you're denying that you are involved with escape attempts at sona prison.
I have never been here before in my life.
And you've never met any of the men incarcerated here?
No!
James whistler?
No.
You know what I've been told?
From prisoners?
I can only imagine.
I've been told that you are the mastermind behind a prison escape
and that you've kidnapped a boy as collateral.
Really?
Am I an alien?
Did I shoot jfk?
Sir, I have no idea who this james wilson...
- whistler. - ...Is!
I'm just here to relax before I have to go back to another year of teaching social studies to freshman idiots.
You're a tourist here?
No, not a tourist, S.
I like to think of myself as a "student of life."
"A student of life"?
Abre la manguera!
What did he say?
"Turn on the hose."
I'm going to give you one chance.
Did you order the escape from sona penitentiary?
Yes or no?
zavala: Yes or no?
You seem concerned for her.
She holds our entire future in her hands.
Yeah, I'm concerned.
Yes or no?
no!
You've proven one thing.
This is not your first time.
come with me.
Do you know either of these men?
I've never seen them before.
That's a lie.
I've never seen them before in my life.
Where and when have you seen her?
She came to see him in visitation, isn't that right?
Is this the woman you work for?
Did she order the prison escape?
Yes or no?
yes.
All right, all righT.
You're the one in charge?
No.
I don't know anything about a prison escape.
I'm just the baby-sitter.
I watch the kid.
Where is he?
Near paloma.
Highway 2.
I can take you.
Take them back to my office.
Put the girl back in the car.
We're going on a drive.
Was it you?
Did you kill sara?
I have no idea who you're talking about.
I'm coming for you.
Congratulations.
You're a regular buster douglas, aren't you?
Hey, what is this?
How'd you get that up there, huh?
Right there. Right there.He's in there.
In here?
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
: I hope he's all right.
Pick me up.
I'm at the shack.
Bring towels.
Hi, lincoln.
Good to see you.
Yeah, thanks for the cigars.
You didn't open the package?
I didn't get around to it today.
You need to make a choice.
Lechero's days are numbered.
You agree?
Then you know what you need to do.
You've done a good job so far.
Now is the time to make a move.
Prove yourself.
Go back in and open the package.
What are they doing in here?
They were here for questioning
Come on. Let's go.
What happened to the general?
The general was found dead this morning off highway 2.
You're goingback inside.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He seemed like a nice man.
What you doing back here?
If you still want to getout of here, I need your phone.
Go inside.
what?
How's lj?
He's fine.You know what?
Susan's not.
He's fine? Are you sure?
Yeah.
I just got off the phone with him.
Why didn't you tell me what was going on?
He could have died because of what you did.
We've still got whistler.
As long as we do, we're okay.
I got to go.
Hey, did you see blanco?
'S walking around like the landlord.
I thought you said lechero was going to take care of it?
He will.
How long has he been saying that?
Look if you and lechero want to go around like an old married couple,
fighting this way or that... maybe you like it in the kitchen.
Hey, you be careful.
Then do something!
Or the next thing you know, you're gonna be taking orders from scofield.
Some people stop at nothing, huh?
Uh... yeah. Whatever.
At least we're back inside.
Which of course is exactly what you wanted.
Isn't it?
What are you talking about?
You let the fox into the henhouse.
The only reason you gave up gretchen's name was
so she could come in and pull you out of the fire.
You wanted me to give up her name.
You know it doesn't end with her.
Yeah, I do.
The question is how do you?
How does a simple fisherman seem to know so much about the company?
When she comes back, and she will... ...
what am I gonna say?
You gonna do this or not?
You can tell her the answer is yeS.
But once we're out, I consider you collateral...
nothing more.
previously on prison break:
The bracing is going to be tricky.
Unless the tunnel gets the proper support,it's all going to come down on our heads.
Listen,I want you to call her up,tell her you've got some information.
Make sure she picks you up,and get in the car,all right?
Just thought you'd want to know.
If you're really leaving,take me with you. Please?
I don't want to be here anymore.
You don't want any part of this.
There's a part of me that doesn't want to believe he works for them
'cause he's the man I loved,the man who was going to take me to mparis.
If he doesn't take you,I will.
Impressive,blanco.
Too bad you won't be around to enjoy it.
How long is this going to set us back?
All right. We got 24 hours to dig out that tunnel.
You mean the one it took you guys three days to dig the first time?
Let's just say,by some miracle,we are able to part the dirt sea,moses.
Then what?
How you plan on getting around the guards' tower?
Michael,mr. Whistler here says that,you know,you got stopped last time by a cloud.
I'm still working on that.
I'd like to know if this girl's gonna put out before I spend any more time buying her drinks!
You know as well as I do what's riding on this.
I'd say I know better.
I don't care who knows what so long as somebody knows how the hell we getting out of here by tomorrow.
You coming?
Not today.
James and I have a lot of things to clear up,
but I'm done trying to do it through a fence.
You ever wish you could go back in time?
Just to remember how it was like when things made sense?
Every day for the last three years.
Why is she staying in the car?
Guess she thinks she'll see him tomorrow.
You've been spending a lot of time together,huh?
And?
You sure that's wise?
Where are we?
Behind schedule.
But we should be on the same side of the fence by tomorrow afternoon.
What do you mean,"should"?
The tunnel gets us into no-man's-land.
To get to the fence,we're going to need a new diversion of the tower guards.
What time?
Daytime's still our best option.
They double the guards at night.
- And the jeep patrols? - Yeah.
And,uh...there's something else.
What?
Oh,yeah,there's a drug lord,too.
You know what?It's not about them.It's about whistler.
- We got to do whatever... - you don't need to know who whistler is.
What about what he's worth?
My son's life.
I just wish there was another way to do this.
Look,man,that's it. There isn'T.
I know.
Listen,you worry about the tunnel,I worry about the guards.
- See you tomorrow. - Tomorrow.
Hey,now,don't skimp on the braces up there.
In fact,if you want to add a little extra,just...
you know,we can work on this railroad all...the livelong day,
but it don't matter if scofield doesn't know what happens once we get off the train.
Once we get out of here,it's every man for himself.
Is that so?
You obviously don't know him very well,shakespeare.
When we broke out of fox river,he tried to screw every one of us.
Half the men ended up either dead,captured or worse.
The guys who are easiest to catch
are the one's who spend more time pissing and moaning at each other than running.
My only advice to you,ecclesiastes 6:13.
"Separate thyself from thy enemies,and take heed of thy friends."
How we doing,alex?
Well,if those braces hold,we could be to the surface sometime tomorrow.
Let's rotate.
Keep everybody fresh.
Welcome to the coal mine,canary.
Cho!
Don't drop your body-water upon me like that!
Hey,it ain't coming from me,I swear.
Engineer,come. Look at this.
- We hit a pipe or something? - Oh,no.
That's right above our tunnel.
That's not going to hold till tomorrow.
So what do we do?
We leave tonight.
tonight?
I thought you said a nighttime escape was impossible.
S up,the tunnel will collapse again,and that'll be the end of it.
It'll be the end for you.
You're the one on a deadline.
What if it gives out while we're inside?
- We end up like buried treasure. - You want out,get out!
Look,you're not pulling this off tonight without all of us working around the clock.
And none of us are ever making it out of here without his plan,
so if you tell me that you can figure out a way how to do this at night,
then I-- we-- can figure out a way how to get that tunnel dug in time.
Let's start digging.
I think you dropped something.
I've read in old newspapers that make it to sona
how americans hold others to standards they ignore.
How they think no one should have power but them.
I tell everyone it's a lie,but I see it's true.
*******Aving.
And I think that after everything I've done to help,
I think it sucks you're not taking me with you!
I know it doesn't seem like it now,but I'm doing you a favor.
I'm giving you a gift.
Oh,wow,life in prison. Thank you.
I've always wanted one of those.
It's better than a life on the run.
I don't belong here.
- All I did was give a guy... - you're not going!
I'm sorry.
It's for the best.
How do you know what's best for me?
Y cuanto me va costar?
Okay,muchas gracias.
It's good to go.
You know where and when to be,right?
If you're not there,we're screwed.
You all right?
I'm fine.
- I'm just going to grab my stuff.  - Yeah.
Probably best if you and james disappear.
I know. I know.
You know where to meet us,right?
You'll be on the...
We'll see you tomorrow then.
Good luck.
You,too.
hey,it's that susan chick. She wants to meet again.
Good.
Let her know everything's on track.
We want to make her feel as comfortable as possible.
Why shouldn't she be?
She's going to get her guy tomorrow,right?
Well,if michael's conscience doesn't get in the way.
What do you mean?
He's having doubts.
About if he can pull it off?
About if he should.
But he's going to go through with it,right?
What are you looking for?
Where the power lines connect to sona's exterior lights.
If cutting the power out there was an option,why didn't we do that in the first place?
One,the power out there isn't controlled from in here.
And,two,there's that.
Every prison has a backup generator.
Even if we cut the lights,they'll just come back on again immediately.
Well,that's a big,bloody problem.
Change of plans,linc.
We're doing this tonight.
Tonight?
Rain,dirt,tunnel,problem.
How long can it hold?
That depends.
Depends on what?
When the rain stops.
You said breaking out at night was impossible.
Yeah,well...
you want to tell me how you're going to pull this off?
Sucre,do you know what I do for a living?
I have a pretty good idea.
I read people.
And you,my friend,are a coloring book.
I think you left this imy car.
Look. That...that was just...I mean...
no. No,no,no,no.
My fault.
I guess I just didn't make myself clr when I laid out the terms of our arrangement.
So I'm going to try again as simply as I know how.
Anything happens-- anything at all i wasn't expecting--
and there will be one less pregnant girl in chicago.
Fernando,this is your last chance.
I want a yes or a no.
Are the brothers gonna break whistler out of sona?
Yes.
Are they planning on handing him over to me?
Yes.
Where do you want me to shoot maricruz first,in the bun or in the oven?
Okay!
There's one thing I heard.
What kind of concerns?
About handing him over.
You got to understand,he broke out some pretty bad guys last time.
I think he's never forgiven himself for that.
He's planning on leaving him behind?
Maybe. I don't know.
It's going down tonight.
Tonight?
Should I be worried?
I called you first thing.
I'm being straight up with you.
That's refreshing.
So I'll see you tonight.
You show me yours and I'll show you mine.
It's going down tonight.
Do you know about that?
I didn't know,I swear.
Get out of here.
How'd it go?
She found the bomb,linc.
The one we put in her car.
How did she find the bomb,sucre?
I don't know,bro. I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Look,I'll make it up to you,I swear.
What kind of trouble?
The rain stopped.
- Does that mean... - No.
The damage is done.
We can't risk waiting.
anything interesting?
Like some coordinates the company might want to get their hands on?
If they didn't want me out of here and your nephew was safe,
would you still be doing this?
Breaking out?
No.
Why would you choose to stay if there was a chance at freedom?
Well,I guess that's the difference between us.
I'm wiing to pay for my sins.
And I'm not?
That's a good question.
water's coming down pretty fast up in here,patron.
Yeah. We have to dig faster.
You know,I've been thinking.
It doesn't have to be every man for himself.
You and I can help each other.
If i need a hand,I'll find someone with a spare.
while it's true I may be lacking something in the west,
I more than make up for it in the north.
Think about it.
Scofield's got us down here doing manual labor; slave labor.
I ain't no slave.
I'm doing this for me.
Why do you think scofield's up there and we're down here?
He's planning something.
Who among us isn't?
what the hell is that?
OK,let's unload here
Make the animals walk through the filth
Come here
Let's go
Good.Good!Keep going!
- we're good. - Yeah.
We're all right. Okay.
yeah.
Long time no see.
Not long enough.
I was thinking that we could have a little chat in person.
Make sure we're all on the same page about what's gonna happen tonight.
All right.
30 minutes,this location. I'm sending a text. Can't we just...
Sorry.What's up?
It's payday
You're first
You need to pick up your check
**gracias.
See you later.
hello.
Hey,papi,it's me.
How much do you know about electricity?
Hey,you're back.
I'm not real comfortable being alone down here with those...
what's that?
Syrup; honey.
Make a little pile of dirt. Gather some dirt.
Scofield said we got to make something to cover the hole once we get out.
So when the lights go back on it's gonna look like nobody ever left.
Go ahead. Spread it around.
I was thinking...
we should be a team,you know?
Not just during the escape,but after.
Well,I mean in the other parts.
Here's an idea.
We go along with scofield's plan,and then when everyone stops to take a breath,
We take 'em back home to face charges.
Hell,we'd be heroes.
Might even get a book deal.
We could write it together,alex. How'd that be?
- A book deal? - Yeah.
Gonna make you happy,brad?
You got a better idea?
Yeah,I do.
Something to do with a wife and kid?
Yeah,something like that.
You got room for one more?
What's a guy like me gonna do?
Let's just let scofield get us out of here,and then we'll worry about everything else,all right?
All right.
Come on. A little more dirt.
Listen very carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
You sure you don't want linc to do this?
He knows more about this than I do.
It's not about what you know.
It's about where you work.
And as a sona employee,my friend,you have the unique ability of not getting shot for being here.
You see the admin building?
I see it.
Go to it and make a left.
To it and left. Got it.
On the other side is a berm.
There should be a metal cage.
That's the backup generator.
Okay,I see it.
Don't let the tower guard see you get too close.
Just act casual.
When I say now,you run and duck behind it.
Almost.
Hold on.
Now!
Okay. Okay.
There should be some writing near the bottom.
I need the name of the manufacturer,make and model number,anything.
Yeah,yeah,yeah,I got it,I got it.
Model number 3210.
All right. Thanks.
That's all I need.
You really think you can pull this off tonight?
You want to know the truth?
No,I just want all of it go down smooth.
For everyone to get what they want.
Yeah,I do.
Listen,even if you get this worked out with the lights,
what are you gonna do about the jeep patrols?
We're just gonna have to take our chances.
Maybe you don'T.
You all right?
Yeah,I'm fine.
Somewhere safe.
Take a load off.
Can I offer you a drink?
I just wanted to get everyone together so we can discuss tonight's agenda.
Maybe nail down a few guidelines.
It's the same as before,nothing has changed.
Actually,I was thinking we should probably include all the players.
Don't you?
What are you doing in here?
Just keeping watch.
Make sure nobody tries to get down to the tunnel.
Who are you calling?
Yeah,hi. Is this,uh,customer service?
Yeah,I'm,uh...
I'm a sub working,building down here in panama,and,um,we got a client on-site.
They're asking questions about the 3210 generator we're installing.
Yeah. Exactly.
anyway,they want to know,if the main power shuts down,
how long are they gonna be in the dark,um,before the generator kicks in?
Yeah. Thanks.I'll hold.
You're a very good liar.
That's the timing?
No,that's,uh... that's it.
Appreciate it.
Well? We gonna make it?
We should have just enough dark to make it out.
With everyone?
Yes.
Susan has got a message.
Why?
Put him on.
It's for you.
Yes?
All right,I got him. What now?
Tell him I want him to listen very carefully to the following instructions.
- She wants you to listen real care... - I can hear.
Instructions about what?
Is she there?
Yeah.
What's going on?
He wants to know what this is about.
All right. I'll tell him.
no!
Was... was that just...
Have you figured out the coordinates yet,james?
Please.
Almost.
Wrong answer.
- No! - No!
I'll get them for you when we get out of here,I swear.
All your promises,your guarantees-- they mean nothing.
I'm pretty sick of waiting around for you boys to screw me over.
I want those coordinates by the end of the day.
we gotta figure this out.
Gotta do something.
Gotta do something.
We both know that you can't just hand over that information.
Why?
Why can't I?
Once they get what they want,they'll have no reason to keep you or your girlfriend or my nephew alive.
So what do I do?
I,I just,I just let them torture sofia?
We'll work something out.
We'll think it through.
I already have.
What is so special about him anyway,huh?
You think he has anything to do with why them people wanted scofield down here in the first place?
It's really none of my business.
What exactly is your business,alex?
Something on your mind?
I'm just saying...
if we needed a bargaining chip,do you think...
a sharp stick in that dull limey would help us out?
There is no "us."
You and me are a lot more alike than you think,alex.
We both know how it feels to lose a great love.
How it feels to kill a man.
Wouldn't it be poetic justice if we could just...
return the favor?
Justice,huh?
If there was an ounce of it left in this world...
you'd be lying face down in the same unmarked grave as the rest of your inbred family.
The only difference between me and you,alex,is a badge,and the last time I checked,
you didn't even have that,so you can just keep on hoping for your happy endings,
alex,you just keep on plowing ahead with them blinders on,
you know,but the thing about them blinders is...
it makes it really hard to watch youback.
It's gonna be better soon,I promise.
If james loves you the way he says he does,he'll give us what we want,
and then you and your white knight can ride off into the sunset.
Unless you're already with him.
Do I look scared,lincoln?
To pull something like this...
you desperate?
You need to stop fighting with me.
If you really understood what was going on,you would know that we're not the bad guys.
Could've fooled me.
Haven't you ever done the wrthings for the right reason?
What are the right reasons,susan?
What is it about whistler that's so important.
I could tell you.
But then I'd have to kill you.
You're gonna do that anyway.
Whistler gives us what we want,maybe I won't have to.
Linc called.
They're on their way.
I figured them out.
The coordinates.
I'm gonna hand them over.
I thought you should know so you can take whatever precautions you can.
What if,uh...
what if you give them the wrong coordinates.
It might buy us some more time.
Like he did with sara?
I'm sorry. I...
I didn't mean to. I,uh...
I just don't know what else to do.
I'm damned if I do. I'm damned if I don'T.
There's no way to win.
It's not about winning anymore.
It's about surviving-- which is not the same as giving up.
But you can go gracefully.
There's honor.
Protecting the ones you love.
Honor's a luxury men like us can't afford.
Can you promise me we'll make it out of here tonight?
No games.
Can you honestly promise me?
I can promise you I'll do everything in my power.
I wish that were good enough.
If you do this...
if you give them what they want...
everything that's been lost will have been for nothing.
What's up?
Take it easy.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
I'm kind of in a hurry
I got some place to be
What's that?
Friends of mine are moving tonight
And they need my help
Tell them you're gonna be late
Let's go
Walk
he's gonna give it to them.
Relax.
I'll see you in a minute.
What are you talking about?
I suppose introductions are unnecessary at this point.
We're here to say good-bye.
Do you have the coordinates,james?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
- I tried to run away... - this is not your fault.
It's mine.
When I took this job,I knew they weren't good people.
I just didn't know how bad they were.
And everything that's happened...
it's all because of me.
And for that I'm truly sorry.
The coordinates.
Just pass them through.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm buying some goodwill.
You're buying her funeral.
You know I have what you need.
and that these men here...
they're all safe.
Do you understand me?
everything's gonna be all right.
I'm impressed.
It seems our fisherman grew himself a set of oysters.
Can you really trust these men with her life?
Yeah.
Yeah,I believe I can.
But there's been some confusion about the timing of things-- last-minute changes,et cetera.
I'm gonna make this clear for everyone involved.
If time runs out and I don't have the second half of those coordinates,
lj and the senorita stop breathing.
Say good-bye,sweetheart.
I've helped you.
Now you help me.
Please.
Just get us out of here.
- Bout the timingon the backup generator? - Yeah.
All we got to do now is cut the power to the exterior lights.
How are you gonna do that?
I'm not-- it can't be accessed from the inside.
How much time have I got?
Let's say,uh,5:15 tomorrow morning.
That should give us enough time to dig out the tunnel before the sun comes up.
What about him?
Well,he manned up-- he could've handed over the information,but he didn'T.
Still concerned about handing him over?
I've got my concerns about pretty much everybody,linc.
- You know what I mean? - Yeah.
Mostly,I'm just tired.
Tired of choices...
consequences.
I just want this to be over... tonight.
Let's do it.
When you're on the run,
you're always looking over your shoulder,listening for the sirens,
wondering if that pretty girl across the street is staring at you because she wants you,or...
because you're wanted.
You change your name,the way you look...
and leave everything you ever knew behind.
And the ones you love,they're the ones who have to pay.
That's what's waiting for you on the outside.
That's why I couldn't bring you on.
Because nothing good can come of this.
Can anything good come from staying in?
It has to be your decision. I...
I cannot be responsible for you.
You won't have to be.
Does your father still have that phone number I gave you?
I think so.
Well,tell him to call my brother if he wants to find out where to pick you up tomorrow.
Does that mean...
it means if a million things fall into place...
I'm gonna see my father tomorrow.
Don't let anyone see you with that phone.
I believe we're ready.
She's a little wet,but she's ready.
Makes me think of the first thing I'll do when we're gonna get out.
Just,does anybody know what's spanish for "don't shoot"?
No dispare.
Just relax. Nobody's gonna get shot.
Just don't panic.
As soon as linc cuts the power,we go.
What about the jeep patrol?
Taken care of.
What about the backup generator?
Backup generator?
Nobody said anything about...
there's a lag from when the power cuts out to when the generator kicks back in.
Well,how long a lag are we talking about here?
30 seconds.
You expect us to run in 30 seconds?
As soon as the lights go out,I'm gone.
With or without you.
Please,my friends
They're expecting me and--
I have some bad news,Jorge
We won't be able to pay you today
That's fine,I-I can wait until-
When we ran your identification through processing...
We found a slight problem
What..kind of a problem
You have a warrant out for your arrest
noW.
Let's go.
Off the bus! Now!
As soon as the lights go out,we got to be ready to move.
You want to tell us what the hell the taquito's doing down here?
He's coming with us.
I don't think so.
That's not up to you.
Oh,you got to be kidding me.
See,we made up our own decision here.
Well,with the time frame being so short and all,
we'd feel a whole lot better about things if we go first.
What are you gonna do,kill me?
- See,if we ain't first,he's not *** - All right!All right!Just...
Look,I think I can explain all this
If I could just get some paperwork from my car
You're not going anywhere
Understand?
all right.
All right,go. Just go.
Just go.
every man for himself,right?
You want to move up in line,too?
No,I think I'm gonna stay back here.
I just don't want to turn my back on anybody.
Rough night?
I got your message. What's the problem?
I lost my keys.
Where'd you find them?
Four feet that way.
Must've dropped them.
How you doing? It's been a while.
Fine. How are you?
Cold.
I, uh...
I need to talk to you about something.
- Grab some lunch at Fascastti's? - I have to get back to work.
Speaking of which, I heard you got fired a few weeks ago.
What was it this time?
You really want to know?
Or you're just enjoying the view from your high horse?
You know what I want?
To not have to be the older brother to my older brother.
What you doing here, Crab?
Long time no see, Mr. Linc. Where you been?
- Here and there. - Mm.
I'm gonna get your 90 grand, all right...
Oh, relax, man, that debt's already been paid.
By who?
Someone who likes to do people favors.
I don't know what it is you're thinking you're getting,
but let's be clear about something.
It's gonna be a few days before I get the money lined up.
Let's not kid ourselves.
You can't get anywhere near that kind of money.
So let's talk about what you can do for me.
Allies are like family. We have disagreements,
but we always seem to smooth things out by Thanksgiving.
Okay, if you had to choose...
I'll take door number three.
Come on, if you had to choose.
The chick in HR.
Michael never cared much for blondes.
How you doing, Michael?
Um, good. I'm good. How are you?
I'm okay.
Lawyer #97.
Benefits are good.
You guys haven't talked?
No, not for a few years. He kind of dropped off the radar.
How is he?
He's, um...
He's... He's Linc.
I don't care who the guy is. I ain't killing no one.
I must have missed the part where I gave you a choice.
Black leather jacket.
Two buttons down the front, three on each sleeve.
One missing on his left-- no, right arm.
Jeans. Faded.
Stain on the right knee.
He does bad things to good people.
Think of this as a $90,000 bullet.
You start fresh,
and you keep me from finding out if there's someone in your life you will do something for.
Uh, I should... I should call you a cab.
You know how you can tell God is a man?
Shoes.
Oh!
Easy.
I'm sorry.
What?
It's, uh...
You're gonna answer it?
He'll leave a message.
He always does.
I need your help, bro.
I'm in something real bad. I can't get out of it.
I need you to straighten me out. My head is all messed up and...
Anyway, it's real important, bro.
You gotta call me.
You gotta call me now.
We can't do this.
I know.
I know.
I'll call you a cab.
Did we get him?
I believe we did, partner.
Are you kidding?
Fernado, we should've whooped that guy's ass.
Please, only time I seen you whoop some ass is when that old man cut in front of you at Arby's.
And he was, like, 102 and blind.
With a plastic hip.
Oh, my God.
What?
Hey, they're waiting for you in 4B.
Oh, pull his film. I'll be there in a  minute.
Okay.
Sergeant Franklin, you never cease to amaze me.
Is there anything you can't get here?
All  right, a deal's a deal.
Prison guard duty.
Away from the front. Safest place you could be.
Thank you.
And my wife and daughter back home thank you, too, sir.
- Hey. - Hi.
Would you give us a minute? Thanks.
Have  you been watching the news?
Why?
I didn't do it.
The Vice President's brother
Do you have any idea what they're gonna do to you?
I didn't do it, man, it was a setup. I didn't do it.
You knew him.
No.
- You worked for his company. - So what?
From which you were fired a few weeks ago.
I loaded containers in the warehouse. Never met the guy.
What the hell, Mike? You sound like one of the damn detectives.
- I'm just saying... - You think I did it?
I heard you owe someone 90 grand.
- Who told you that? - People talk.
I may be a lot of things, but I'm not a murderer.
Then what were you doing in that garage last night?
You admitted to the police you were there.
I don't know how it's come to this.
And you can't keep blaming Mom for dying
and Dad for leaving, because I was there, too.
Difference is, I got out.
Mom had life insurance, I took my half, put myself through school,
What did you do with your half, Linc?
Everything's not how it looks, Michael.
I hope for your sake, that's true.
Here... here is where we want the turn to anger.
Trust me, that won't be a problem.
Now remember to stress his record as a repeat offender.
We need the public behind us if we want the death penalty.
And where are we with Governor Tancredi?
He has aspirations. He won't be a problem.
Uh, 30 seconds, Madam Vice President.
The papers have already crucified him.
The police say they got a phone call right after the murder
from someone claiming they saw Lincoln running from the garage.
He was into someone for 90 grand.
What do you need that kind of money for? Drugs? Bribes?
Forget about what you want to be true.
Let's look at this objectively.
- Maybe you should, too. - I am.
All right, you know what? I promised I wouldn't say anything,
but I'm getting tired of you talking about him
like he's some guy from the neighborhood that you used to know.
- He's your brother. -I know
and I know he helped you out with your dad back in the day,
but you should see the kind of person he is now-- the kind of people he keeps friends with.
You want to know what the 90 grand was for?
- I think I do. - You
What do you mean?
The money you got when you were 18 years old from your mother's life insurance.
The money that paid for your degree,
that got you this job, that bought you your loft.
- How? - He borrowed it.
Knew it would be tough to pay back,
but that didn't matter, because he thought you deserved it.
He also knew you'd never accept it if you knew it came from him.
Michael....you are where you are because of your brother.
You're telling me he is where he is because of me?
Why?
Why didn't you tell me about the money?
What did she make of all this? About me?
I don't know.
Glad she got out when she did, huh?
You know how she feels about you.
It's  been the same way ever since we were kids.
Yeah.
I owe you an apology.
For what?
The night you called.
If we talked, maybe I could have stopped you...
Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's not your fault.
Then whose is it?
Listen up.
You need to forget about this.
Move on. Work hard, do what you do.
I can't do that.
Oh, yes, you can. And you will.
Here's the part I don't understand.
All the evidence is lining up in a path that leads directly to you.
They say they have you on tape.
Pulling the trigger.
How the hell did someone make it look like you did?
Perfect.
Perfect's a strong word, Cuz.
I got strong feelings, bro.
I'm telling you, she might be the one.
She from the block?
Do you think you could hold on to a girl from the PH?
I want to take her out to dinner.
You'll see. Someplace real nice.
How are you going to afford a place like that?
- Open the drawer! - Hey, hey, okay!
- Open the drawer! Yo, yo! - Okay, okay!
- Quick! Quick! Quick! - All right, okay!
Now!
Actually... This is all I need.
Okay.
Appreciate your business, man.
I brought you a gift from the hospital.
I brought you a gift from the hospital.
I'm telling you, this is like Christmas.
And you... work at the north pole.
If the north pole had gunshot wounds and...
Seriously, I don't know how you work there.
What do you mean?
I like to help people.
And you like helping yourself.
And you like helping your friend.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Can you hear？Are you Okay？
Can you hear？Are you Okay？
Call somebody! Who's got a telephone?! Call 911!
Help!
Are you a doctor?
Can you help us?
Well, do something!
At ease.
The whiskey that you ordered, sir, will be here in a couple of days.
That's fine. I actually brought you here to talk to you about something else.
Prisoner abuse report you filed?
Yes, sir.
I need to know how far you're willing to go with this.
Whatever it takes, sir.
I particularly have no love for the desert donkeys,
but I do have some for the Geneva Convention.
Something like this gets out,
might open up our boys to similar treatment from the enemy.
I understand that, sir.
But I'm not planning on calling a press conference.
What I'm saying is, what I saw was wrong,
and someone needs to take responsibility for it, sir.
All right.
What? What the hell is going on, sir?!
that you be dishonorably discharged from the United States Army.
What?! For what?
For engaging in illegal, black market...
You asked me to get that stuff!
I kept it to myself.
Maybe you should learn to do the same.
You can't do this. You can't do this!
Has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
What say you?
on the count of murder in the first degree,
we find the defendant...
guilty.
The defendant will remain in custody until one week from today,
when we commence the penalty phase.
Don't be.
It's not your fault.
- Know what I like? - Hmm?
How after we make love...
you get this little puddle of water in your belly button.
And get out of there! It's disgusting there!
I think it's beautiful.
I think you're beautiful.
Oh, you got to give me a few more minutes.
Stop!
From the future.
What do you want from the future?
Would you run if I said you?
Would you chase me if I did?
I don't get it.
All these commercials show brothers learning computer skills, new technologies.
Uncle  Sam didn't teach me nothing but cadence and kill.
You check over at the Price-Mart?
Ain't hiring.
Especially with a brother with a dishonorable discharge.
Goes right to the bottom of the pile.
How long you think you gonna keep this up?
Until somebody gives me a job.
Nah, I'm talking about lying to Kacee.
Your unit's been on leave for a long damn time now.
Pretty soon they gonna stop thinking you're lucky, and she's gonna start asking questions.
Yeah, well, then I need to start finding some answers.
Look, I happen to know of an employment opportunity.
Come on, man, you know I don't get down like that.
- It's just driving a truck. - Yeah.
A to B. That's it.
Uncle Sam taught you how to drive trucks, didn't he?
Yeah. He also taught me to look inside.
It might be illegal, but it's also rent.
A to B, your call.
Yeah.
- They didn't even let her testify... - Who?
And that cop? Changed  his story a dozen times.
What part of "move on" don't you get?
After Mom died, and it was just you and me.
I remember having trouble sleeping,
never knowing where you were.
But when I'd wake up in the morning,
there'd be this paper bird,
an origami crane,
sitting next to my bed.
And I never knew what it meant exactly,
but I figured it was your way of letting me know you were checking in on me.
Anyway, I looked it up. The crane.
It stands for familial obligation...
watching out for your own.
Maybe it's my turn to watch out for you.
So, same time tomorrow.
No, man, they're, uh,
transferring me to a prison where I wait until they execute me.
Can I still visit?
Yeah. It's not that far. Place called Fox River.
Yeah
Why?
Nothing.
How come there's four?
Well, uh, Mommy's new friend is coming over for dinner again.
Again? He just came over last night.
I like him.
Well, I do, too.
And I want you both to be extra polite,
because he's stopping by Malarkey's on his way home from work,
and he's bringing us a really good meal.
In fact, you two go wash your hands.
Don't you look lovely this evening.
- I'm gonna do it. - Do what?
I'm gonna propose to Maricruz.
Are you serious?
When?
As soon as I can afford the ring.
So what, like, 10, 20 years?
What's your problem, man?
Why can't you just be happy for me?
I'm just trying to protect you.
What, you think you can give her everything she wants?
Takes more than money to do that.
You know I love you, Cuz.
Just think you should look at the reality here.
Seriously, Primo, how are you gonna afford a ring for a girl like that, huh?
- Open the door! - Hey, hey, hey, okay, okay!
Now!
Hey, this fine?
Actually, I'm gonna need a little bit more this time.
Okay, okay.
Here you go.
I'm sorry
Okay
Anyone asking questions?
Not loud enough to hear.
God, I can't remember the last time I was this much of a nervous wreck.
School Board, second term, 1992?
Secluded, no real access roads, perfect for what you're looking for.
Only one problem.
- What's that? - It's over $2 million.
Didn't my poor brother, Terrence, leave something for me in his will?
You'd have to ask your accountants, ma'am.
Tell them to use that money.
I'm paying for his mistake
He can pay for the damn house
And I've been clean for 18 months now.
I'll tell you, I've never been happier.
That actually might be the wrong word.
I'll be honest, there were times I was using I left pretty damn happy.
But... what I feel is different now.
I feel, uh... I feel joy.
So here I am. I know that...
all I can do every day is the next right thing.
And I think, for me right now, that means going back to work.
I, uh... I don't know, maybe...
maybe counseling, um...
I want to help people get from where I've been to where I am.
You used to be a doctor, right?
Uh, I still am, in theory. Why?
Well, I was just thinking that I might know of a job opening where I work.
Really? Where's that?
The prison?
Yeah. I know it sounds like a strange idea.
Uh, maybe...
maybe you and I could, uh... maybe we could talk about it over dinner.
Oh, my God. Um...
Thank you. Really. Uh...
I... Tonight's kind of my night to work on my resume. Um...
Oh. Yeah. Of course.
Sorry. I, uh...
But thank you, really, for the, um, the referral.
Yeah
You know, math was never my best subject, either. But, um...
I got through it by learning some new tricks.
You want to learn some tricks, Gracey?
Like what?
Like your nine-times tables
Ready? Nine times one is...
Nine times two is...
Nine times three is...
Exactly.
You got it. Now keep on going.
Mommy, Mommy
Did you see what Teddy taught me?
Yes. That's great, honey. Go show your brother.
Zack, look. Nine times one...
Nine times two...
Right, right, left, left...
Left, left, right, right,...
Hey. Um, thank you.
Let me get your change.
You want your change?
Keep it.
Season
Do you love it? That's different.
- Hey. - Hey.
Daddy!
Hey, sweetheart, come here.
- Hey, there. - Hey.
You know, I got, uh...
I got to tell you something.
And it's going to be really hard to hear.
- Okay. - Okay.
What?
Well, the thing is...
...I'm being shipped back off.
What?
Yeah, um,
my unit just got called back for another tour, baby.
I can't believe it.
Deployment orders just came down.
With the Italians pulling out and everything...
- Tell them no, Daddy! - Aw.
Come here, baby.
Can you give me a hand with something out back?
That's my sister you're lying to in there.
Which is why I know you're gonna take care of them when I'm gone.
This is crazy.
Maybe.
So is the way I got kicked out the Army.
So's the way I got busted for driving that truck.
And so's the way I feel about that woman up in there.
She married a military man,
who knows how to take care of his business.
Now, if I look like one of these thugs, now...
what do you think she's gonna do? Huh? How long you think she's gonna wait for me while I'm inside?
I don't know, man.
You owe me this, man.
Don't you ever let her know where I am.
You feel me?
Usually, I do this the other way.
- Why do you want to... - I want what I want.
You show this to anyone else...
I am calling the whole thing off.
My therapist said...
she said that I'm holding too much in
and that I need to confront you
to let you know how betrayed I feel.
I let you into my life,
my home...
My God, I let you near my children!
I never touched them.
You should have told me what you were.
You think you're the only one who feels betrayed?
Real love.
For the first time in my life.
And then to have you do me like that,
to just throw me out to the dogs, just toss me out the back door like...
- You're a murderer, Teddy! - That's not...
I have sinned in the past, but when I met you, that
person, that one that did all those terrible things, he died,
and I was reborn.
By the grace of your love, I was a...
a new man, a better man.
No.
That doesn't just erase the man who killed 6 students in Alabama.
I guess that's where you're right.
Because when you sent me here, to this place, with these people,
it brought that old, dirty bastard right back home.
In fact, there was a candle in the window,
just waiting for me to walk up them front steps.
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get out of here someday.
And when I do......don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like, Susan.
It's almost over.
and then things will start getting back to normal.
I know that you've been through a lot,
but I promise you, the worst is now behind us.
My dear sister...
...you have no idea what I've been through.
Previously on Prison Break
You know you got a couple of foxes in your henhouse, right?
They both want out of here.
They'll behave until then
Look, this is it, man.
Ain't no do-overs this time.
We break out tonight,
or we ain't never getting out.
He's leading you off a cliff, boys.
And you acting like you still in charge.
Pretend I ain't here.
Yeah, you and the radio.
The thing I can't quite figure is,
with a crap storm this thing's become,
why they haven't killed you.
We have an employee who's not working out.
We fire her.
It needs to be that simple.
She's the vice president of the United States.
That's all she'll ever be, Jim.
What's going on?
Just-just give me a chance.
no!
Where's the lawyer?
We're through.
hey, hey, hey, hey.
You okay, old head?
No.
Oh, god...
sound the alarm.
Sound the alarm!
Come on!
Come on!
grab my hand!
Grab my hand...
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
We got a 10-98!
Inmates over the wall!
Who was with you?!
Nobody!
- Nobody, huh? - No.
Talk or I swear to god,
I will snap your neck right here!
I don't know!
names,i want to names
And that vanilla ice kid.
Who else?!
And that bug-eyed j-cat.
Was there anybody else?
Was there anybody else?!
We got inmates over the wall!
How many?
Eight.
Warden?
Get my shotgun.
Pope's already given orders for all the co'S...
did I stutter?
Get me my shotgun!
Those piles of crap,doing what they just did,
they just signed their death warrant.
Every last one of them.
When those men went over the wall,
they made a choice.
That choice makes them a threat to society once again.
Now as many of you know,
some of those men are convicted killers.
Now, our job is to protect
and ensure the safety of the general population.
That means if we have to bring them down to ensure that safety,
by god we will do it!
This time we're playing for keeps, gentlemen.
Now it's been at least 12 minutes, since they went over that wall.
That's one mile on foot at best.
If they got their hands on a vehicle,
they could be ten miles from here.
So let's get moving!
Yo, come on, man,
we got to roll.
We don't got to do anything but wait right here.
Let them get ahead of us.
I don't know if we're gonna get a chance, papi.
Dogs. Son of a bitch.
They're coming right for us.
Nobody move.
They can't smell us.
but they can see us.
Prison Break Season 01 Episode 22
Hey..... Can't get to the phone.
Leave a message after the beep.
Look, I just landed in Montana.
And this house,
I know it.
then I wanted to say thank you.
soft money makes the world go around.
You know it, and I know it.
You cut my funding
and I can't run a proper campaign without it.
There was a lot of internal debate, trust me.
And there's every chance you can still win with your message,
- and it would certainly be our loss... - oh, cut the crap.
Is there anything else you want to tell me,
or did you just come here to twist the knife you stuck in my back?
Well, actually,
I came here to express our gratitude
for all that you've done for us over the years.
And to let you know that this isn't personal.
- Surely you've been in politics long enough to know that. - Look,
is this about the energy bill?
The energy bill has nothing to do with it.
Why am I finding that so tough to believe?
I'm a grown woman.
How about you give it to me straight?
All right.
All right.
The bottom line,
is that you can't affect change in the oval office.
And that is what we need the most:
Certitude.
Simply put...
you can't get things done.
Well, maybe you don't know me so well.
I highly suggest that in the coming weeks,
as the race narrows and the candidates start falling out...
that you walk away,
quietly,
of your own volition.
Otherwise,maybe it'll be...
of the company's volition.
Hey, hey, take the suit off.
You're practically glowing in the dark.
- I only got my skivvies on underneath. - Take the suit off!
I'll freeze to death!
- Hey! Hey, hey! - Hurry up.
- We got to do something about that freak. - You got it.
- Now, come on. - Come on, hurry up.
Where the hell is the van?
Eye-tie, where in the hell is the van?
Ye of little faith.
Come on, come on.
Watch out.There, I told you.
Behind the wheel,cro-magnon.
what the hell you doing?
I'm getting us invisible.
- What? - The keys,where are they?
I told you, in the garbage can by the trees in a plastic bag.
What are you waiting for?
Come on, come on
no, no, no, no!
No!
We got the on-ramps to 55 and 80 being monitored.
We've got traffic checks on 171, 6 and 53.
How are we doing with the wiretaps?
They're being set up on all the family members of the escapees as we speak.
Surveillance teams are being established outside the residences as well.
Thank you.
What do you got?
Door wasn't forced.
Lock wasn't picked.
As far as I can tell,
they basically just walked right in.
I don't see how that's possible.
These doors are locked down every night when we leave.
It's priority number one.
Only thing I can think is...
what?
Someone left it open for them.
and you taking that particular seat?
What is it exactly you got up underneath there, huh?
What the hell are you doing?
You think that's gonna stop me, huh?
Think twice,johnny boy, hmm.
You shoot me,
pretty here will be dragging around 170 pounds of dead alabama flesh with him.
And considering
so I just don't think you're gonna be pulling that trigger.
No.
you ?????give me the key,???
you son of a bitch.
Get it, get it.Get it.
You looking for this?
Come on.
- Spit it out! - Spit it out!
Come on.
They drink this,
it's only a matter of minutes.
This glycoside saxitoxin hybrid goes to work in the blood stream instantly.
Five minutes is the outside limit even the strongest cardiac muscles can continue to function.
After that--
massive cardiac arrest with no chance of survival.
What about toxicology tests?
Well, they'll reveal nothing.
Death will appear to be from natural causes.
This is high treason,
you know that don't you?
It's fresh, boss.
From tonight?
Can't be more than an hour old.
Dogs get the scent?
Already have.
Hey, boss, check this out.
Captain...
this guy lives up the road.
Works on the property during the day.
You see a vehicle parked here?
I think so, yeah.
What did it look like?
Uh, like a van.
A blue van.
You didn't think to report it to the authorities?
A parked car?
If you think I won't gut you myself to get that key,
you're in for a big surprise.
I encourage you to remember the last time you came at me with a knife.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Both of you!
You can settle this in Mexico.
How far to the airstrip?
Five miles, maybe.
your jet better be there, Mr. Mafia.
You feel me?
It better be there.
Canine unit being deployed.Over.
Roger that.
Push past the search perimeter before we can pick up track. Over.
They're everywhere out there.
Tell me something I don't know.
You're saying you don't know anything about this?
Honestly, I don'T.
It wasn't me.
Then who was it?
Only you and dr. Tancredi were left at the end of the night.
The orderly confirmed that.
It wasn't me.
No.
I know you know something, katie.
And anything you know,
you have got to tell me.
If you don't,
you are going to lose a lot more than your job.
Withholding information makes you an accessory.
And I will press that button if you don't start talking!
All I want to do is touch her belly,
feel that he's in there.
After that,
whatever I got to do,
I'll figure it out.
I just want to touch her belly.
We're close, papi.
We got trouble.
Yo, dawg, man, this is bananas.
We got to get off this road.
Any other way to the airstrip?
This is the only road.
Let's just run this bitch.
Somebody shut him up,
or I will.
Can we go back?
That won't do us any good.
It'll only get us farther from where we need to be.
Which means we got to bust that roadblock.
Maybe not.
We've got to try and go around.
Come on.
We're gonna get that key from you.
I don't care if you got to crap it out.
You got a foul mouth sometimes, pretty.
What?
Son of a bitch, we're stuck!
Everybody out.
Listen to the speech tonight?
Need some id.
Secret Service.
Have at it.
Come on!
this thing ain't going nowhere!
How far is the air strip?
On foot?
Maybe two miles.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Let's move.
Three-legged race over here ain't going to make it ten feet.
We'll manage, won't we?
Sure, pretty.
We're teammates.
Teammates till the end.
Let's get out of here!
Let's go!
go
Let's go.
This is as far as you go, my friend.
What?
No, man, you can't leave me out here, not like this.
We had a deal, remember?
but come on, bro.
You and I,
we're not bros.
I don't think you want me telling the guys what I know.
Now walk.
we got trouble, pretty.
We got more than that
Go! Go!
Come on
Oh my God
Oh, come on
And now what?
What do we do now Michael?
I don't believe this
What now?
It is clear. I'll gonna pop back
It's coming back y'all! It's coming back!
Make yourself small.
There's no way we are gonna make two miles like this.
Especially with that bird up there.
We are if I got something to do with it.
excuse me.
What can I do for you?
Sort of was going to ask you the same question.
I run the tower during the day.
There's no traffic allowed here after sundown.
Had some mechanical problems.
Need me to take a look at anything?
No, no, we got it.
Don't trouble yourself
We'll be on our way in no time.
You sure?
Positive.
Okay.
Have a good night,hey, buddy?
you, too.
Those guys better hurry up.
it's me.
I've got an unidentified aircraft here at goose park.
Think you better have a look at it.
Hurry it up.
just let papi work a little bit of his magic, okay?
You know what you're doing?
Are you kidding me?
Hot-wiring this thing is like hot-wiring a toaster.
Now, if it were to be an acura,
or one of those chinese cars,
that's a whole different story.
Electronic ignition,
computer chips,forget about it.
But no, we're good.
that chopper's gonna be coming back again,so hurry up.
What they got in mexico, anyhow?
You never been there?
Ain't never been nowhere except for iraq,
What you looking at?
Look, man...
is it a place where you can have a family?
Lots of families down there,
so I hear.
Man, you know what I'm talking about.
For a black man,
an american man with a family.
So that's the plan,?
They're going to meet you down in mexico?
it's worse to not see them.
And I can't do that no more.
Not much of a life for them.
But it'll be a life.
More than what me and them have been having for the last two years, man.
They're family, snowflake.
Ain't no way in hell I'm leaving them behind.
We're good.
I must have done this a thousand times.
Man, I thought you got busted for armed robbery.
that's what they caught me for.
Red's the juice,
white is the ground.
Strike them together
and we blow this town.
What?
What？
I don't get it.
Great!
That's just great
Okay.
Sorry.
engine's still warm,
and I don't see any other tire tracks out here.
They're on foot,
and judging by how hot this engine is,
they haven't gone far.
Five, ten minutes ahead of us, at the most.
Where are you?
143rd street on the north
and 55 on the west.
Units are in place along all those roads.
And I've got a dozen more coming.
Brad, this could be over quicker than we thought.
We've got 'em boxed in.
Sir, we've got an update on dr. Tancredi.
Tell me.
None of the staff had any interaction with her.
She left work suddenly in the early afternoon.
Returned for maybe an hour,
then left again.
Has anyone been able to reach her?
Doesn't have a home line,
cell phone seems to be shut off.
Chicago pd identified her car outside her residence.
They're getting an emergency warrant to go in.
Sir, it's none of my business,
but are you going to call the governor?
This is his daughter we're talking about.
Captain, the dogs picked up a trail.
Which way?
That way and that way.
They split up?
Looks like it.
What the hell we waiting for?
I think it's pretty clear that our policies have been effective.
We've had 14 consecutive quarters of gtp growth above three percent.
Tax cuts are working.
Madame vice president!
Madame Vice President,
a lot of people question the wisdom of granting tax cuts to the oil industry,
in light of the fact that they're seeing record profits.
Do you have thoughts on that?
We're a market-driven economy,peter.
Punishing companies for being a good business model
doesn't make a whole lot of sense to this administration.
Madame vice president!
Thank you.
Madame vice president,
are you saying...
...if you're elected president?
If those tax breaks result in growth, yes.
Excuse me?
Excuse me? Sir? Yes?
Sir, can I...
where are they?
They were way the hell back there.
This ain't going to work like this.
We've got to do something.
This way.
come on.
What's going on?What's going on?
what the hell you doing?!What the hell you doing?!
I swear to god!
You swear what?
I guess it was just meant to be,hey, now, fellas?
he's lucky I didn't take this to his head.
You cut his...
you cut his...
You... you cut his...
Hello?
Hello
Hello?!
come on, let's go.
We can't leave him just like...
you want to stay here?Be my guest.
I need to speak with the governor.
Yes?
Governor, I'm sorry to bother you,but, uh,
there's been an...--are you watching this?
Watching what？
I suggest you turn on your tv, warden.
Doctors at washington medical center have corroborated
that president mills was admitted into emergency care here a little more than 45 minutes ago.
In the chief surgeon's words,president mills suffered massive cardiac arrest
and doctors were unable to revive him.
The news out of washington medical center is official now.
an undisclosed location being sworn in as the 46th president of the united states.
...Will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states,
and will to the best of my ability,preserve, protect
and defend the constitution of the united states.
I hereby recognize you as the 46th president of this country.
And now if you'll excuse me,I have a lot to attend to tonight.
Thank you all.
And you said I couldn't get things done.
Madam vice president,perhaps we could get together and discuss how to move forward...
it is "president" now, madam.
And you're going to have to talk to my organizers.My schedule is suddenly quite full.
I'm sure you'll understand.
It's the police.We have a warrant to come in.
It's easier if you just open the door.Otherwise we're going to come on in.
The airstrip's on the other side of that field.
Just 500 yards and this whole thing's over.
He's not moving.
Every second we stay here is another chance for them to find the plane.We got to go now.
Wait, wait.
all right, let's go.Let's go.
If this doesn't work out,I just want you to know, I...
I know.
I know.
Freeze! Don't move!
I'll tell you when we got to go.
no Man, we got to go.
fire her up.
This stunt... by Lincoln Burrows'  defense counsel
is an affront  to the memory of my brother.
We made an imprint of the deceased's teeth
and compared them to the dental records of Terrence Steadman.
They were a perfect match.
Nobody.
I can see it.
keep it moving, come on.Come on, they're close behind us.
Let's go. Hurry.
No!No!No!
What do we do now?
We run.
This way.
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THAILAND
Do you know him?
John!
John!
Do you know where John is?
Over there
John!
John Rambo
I don't believe this
So where did you come in from?
Washington
Good to see you again
Yeah, you too
You want to... uh... tell me about it?
About what?
How yesterday I see you stick fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok
You saw that?
Yeah
Today I find you working in a monastery
They let me live here and I help out fixing things
And the stick fighting?
I do that for a little extra money
Yeah. I saw you give it to the monks
You see a lot
Colonel
Who are they?
They're partly the reason I'm here
Bob
This is Robert Griggs
He's a field officer with local embassy
John Rambo
Pleasure
You're certainly not east to find
Why are you keeping track?
Like the Colonel says
Good men are hard to find
John
I'd like you to look at these photos
I don't know how much you know about Afghanistan
Most people can't find it on a map
But over two million civilians,
mostly peasant farmers and their families
have been systematically slaughtered by invading Russian armies
Every new weapon...
Including chemical warfare...
has been used to eliminate these people
They've been very successful on many levels
I assume you're out of touch with the current status of the war
After nine year of fighting,
Afghan Forces are getting shipment of stinger missiles
They're beginning to hold their own against air strikes
Except for one region
50 miles over the border
The Soviet commander there is exceptionally brutal
As those photos indicate
He's managed to strangle off all aid from the outside
So, we want to...
investigate the problem first hand
What does that has got to do with me?
They've asked me to go in
You're not doing it?
Yes. And I want you to come with me, John
I put in my time
What does that mean?
It means my wars is over
I thought you said he was this great soldier
Colonel
Looks like we got a long walk down those stairs
Don't be down on him
He's just following orders
This mission's important, John
Do you really think we'll make a difference?
If I didn't, I wouldn't be going
It didn't before
That was another time
Come with me, John
I don't know what you think about this place
But I like it
I like being here
I like working here
I like belonging to something
You do belong to something
Not this
When will you come full circle?
What are you talking about?
You said your war is over
Maybe the one out there is
But not the one inside you
I know the reasons you're here, John
But it doesn't work that way
You may try, but you can't get away what you really are
What do you think that?
A full-blooded combat soldier
Not anymore. I don't want it
That's too bad because you're stuck with it
Let me tell you a story, John
A sculptor found a stone, a special stone
He dragged it home, worked on it for months, until he finally finished it
is friends said he'd created a great statue
The sculptor said he hadn't created anything
The statue was always there
He just cleared away the small pieces
We didn't' make you to this fighting machine
We just chipped away the rough edges
You're always be going to be tearing away at yourself
until you come to terms with what you are
Until you come full circle
I guess I'm not ready yet
Well. I got to move
Promise me. You'll look me up, when you get stateside, huh?
I promise
Colonel
I'm sorry
But it's got to the end for me some time
I understand
Take cover!
Drop your weapons!
And remain where you are
You cannot escape!
We will not attack if you do not run!
Drop your weapons!
You have no chance to escape!
Drop your weapons!
Now!
Rambo
Something went wrong
What happened?
Soviets intercepted the team just over the border
From what we get it,
Trautman and the rest of his party...
have been taken to a regional command post
What are you doing about it?
We can't do anything about it
I'm sorry
I just thought you should know
What about me?
What about you?
Can you get me in?
You're not serious
Oh, yeah. I'm serious
It can't be done official
Make it unofficially
If you give it done, I want you to know up front that...
if you're captured or if any of this leaks,
we'll deny any participation...
or even knowledge of your existence
I'm used to it
I'll get back to you
Peshawar, Pakistan near the Afghan Border
You want to buy?
Many guns here
No
I'm looking for Mousa Gani
What's your name?
John Rambo
Wait here
They sell many in Afghanistan
Many land mines
Land mines everywhere
I am Mousa Gani
What is it you want?
I was sent by Griggs
You do not look like men Griggs sent before
You not look like you are with military
I'm not
What you are?
A mercenary?
No
You're not military or mercenary What are you?
Lost tourist?
I'm no tourist
Sorry
Do you know where the American is?
Yes
In Soviet fort
Near the village of Khowst 30 miles over border
Mr Griggs sent you supplies you asked for
You wish to see them now?
Yeah
Is this what you asked for?
Yeah
I never see this before. What are these?
Detonators
And this?
What is this for?
It's a blue light
What does it do?
Turns blue
I see
Can you tell me how many more men come with us?
There's no rescue team It's just me
Just you?
Come on, this is no good
I cannot take only one man to the fort
You needed more men to help
Griggs said you'd take me in
Take me in
I need to take medical supplies
If I not take it, many people will die
Do you understand?
Rambo, I do not know who you really are
But by the way you look,
I can see you have no experience in war, do you?
Come on, do you?
I've fired a few shots
A few shots?
Come on
Maybe you should go back home
And think it all over again for a very long time
I did think it over
You did?
Well. This is your choice
But let me tell you
You cannot get this American alone
If you fail, do not blame me
I will accept no responsibility
That sounds familiar
My name is Colonel Zaysen, the Regional Commander of this sector
Do you realize,you're the first American
captured in Afghanistan?
Congratulations!
I believe you are planning to supply enemy rebel forces...
with stinger missiles intended to destroy Soviet aircraft
If I'm going to be interrogated,
I want to be interrogated by your superiors
Out here, I have no superiors
I am in full command
You are alone here
Abandoned by your government
What do you want?
Cooperation
This sector has been under total control for over five years
There is little more I can do here
It is as you say
Without challenges
If you supply to me worthy information...
about more stinger missiles you are planning to deliver
it could provide a way out of this for us both
After all, in the end, what everyone really wants is...
Peace
The Kremlin's got a sense of humor
Please explain
You talk peace and disarmament to the world
And here you are wiping out a race of people
We are wiping out no one
I think you are too intelligent to believe such absurd propaganda
Now again, where are the missiles?
I don't know anything about any missiles
Of course you do
But you don't seem to realize
I'm providing a way out for us both
You expect sympathy?
You started this damn war!
Now you have to deal with it!
And we will
It's just a matter of time before we achieve a complete victory
There won't be a victory!
Every day your war machines lose ground to...
poorly armed, poorly equipped freedom fighters
The fact is you underestimated your competition
If you studied the history,
you will know these people have never given up to anyone
They'd rather die, than be slaves to an invading army
You can't defeat a people like that
We tried
We already had our Vietnam
Now you're going to have yours
So, you wish to test me!
Good
This is Afghanistan
Alexander The Great tried to conquer this country
Then Genghis Khan, then the British
Now Russia
But Afghan people fight hard
They'll never be defeated
Ancient enemy make prayer about these people
You wish to hear?
Very good. It says:
May God deliver us from the venom of the cobra
Teeth of the tiger
And the vengeance of the Afghan
You understand what this means?
That you guys don't take any shit
Yes. Something like this
We go now
To the north, there are many caves
We will travel through them
It'll be safer
We go
These caves lead us to the valley of five lions
In ancient days, the Afghan king was asked to send 500 warriors into battle
He said: Only five
His greatest five and they won
He said: It's better to send five lions than 500 sheep
What do you think of this?
The king was lucky
Lucky?
How much longer to the village?
About two hours
Where in my sector are the missiles being delivered?
I don't know
You're a liar
Where?
Where?
All right. I tell you
I knew you were lying
Now, where are the missiles located?
Close
How close?
In your ass
You've tried my patience long enough
I tried to be civilized
The name of John Rambo
Do you know it?
No
He says there are plans for a rescue attempt with the help of some rebels
He also says he knows where this man is going
We will welcome him
It's the last village in the valley
About 100 men here
They have a lot of kids here
Yes. And they are good fighters, too
I tell the leaders, we want to talk
They never see man look like you
These are Mujahedeen horsemen
10000 horsemen more are waiting at the border to get weapons
When they get it, they come back here to fight
Let's go to the hospital
He's the only doctor for 500 kilometers
The first medicine they get in two months
More gifts from the Soviets
They look like toys, but they are mines
We teach children not to touch
Some learn too late
Who's that?
His name is Uri
He's Russian
Deserter?
He call himself a Defector
There are many like him
He's the one who can help the most
He knows the inside of the fort
I think we should go now
Mine starts here
At 1 meter like this
Then go 2 meters like this and like this
They have four towers
Four guards
Here, here, here and here
Where do they keep the prisoners?
Here
If we get in there, is there another way out?
Underground, where is all bad water
I do not know words for this place
He means sewer
Where is it?
Here
Outside, it goes there
Guards patrol there
I do not think you go this way
We should go through the mine fields
They will not expect it
This cannot be done
There are many spetnaz commandos
We are only these
We have lost many men
We lose many more if we go there
I don't need many men
What is it that you want to do?
I need two men to get me into the mine field
And two to help me to escape
If this is done, Soviets will come here like before
And more people will die
I can't wait
You must wait for help, the way we wait
Then I'll go alone
And you will die
Then I die
Wait!
Please don't go!
My name is Masoud
before you understand why we are not ready to help
You must not judge us,
Most of the Afghan people are very strong
And we are determined not to be driven from our land
Our children die of disease, mines and poison gas
And the women are raped and killed
Last year, in the valley of Laghman, the next valley
6000 Afghans were killed
Pregnant women were cut with bayonets
and their babies thrown into the fires
This is done, so they will not have the next generation of Afghans
Yet nobody sees anything or reads anything in the papers
What you see here are the Mujahedeens soldiers
Holy warriors
To us, this war is a Holy war
And there's no true death for a Mujahedeen
because we have taken our last rites
We consider ourselves dead already
To us, death for our land and God is an honor
So, my friend
What we must do...
is to stop this killing of our women and children
If getting this man free, so he can return to the free world...
and tell what happens here is necessary
then of course, we will help
Leave us now
So we may speak among ourselves and find the best way to free this man
Thank you
We thank you
Don't worry They will decide soon
Got to get in tonight

What makes you so valuable to him?
This bastard tried to destroy me tonight
But he failed!
At sunrise, I'll hunt him down and have his skin hang on the wall!
You don't have to hunt him
What?
He'll find you
Are you insane?
One man against thirty commandos?
Who do you think this man is? God?
No. God would have mercy. He won't
It's alright, nobody's here

The trail is very difficult

Get out of here!
It's going to blow!
Take what you can, John!
Come on! Move it! Move it!
Come on!
We've got to get to the border
We'll stay here
We know where to go
Which direction, John?
Northeast
Hold it, John
I've got to rest a minute
How's the wound?
You taught us to ignore pain, didn't you?
Is it working?
Not really
Don't take it personally
Thanks
You go on ahead and see if you can get a cover
Ok!
John!
John!
That was close, John, how are you?
Well-done
We don't want to make it easy for him
We better split up
I'm sorry I got you into this
No, you're not
Are you listening?
Who are you?
Your worst nightmare
That's good timing
What are friends for?
You get back to the ho
I'll cover you and see if there's any left
John!
Across the valley is the border
We did it, John
Yeah
Wait
What the hell is that?
The son of a bitch
Do not try to retreat
You cannot escape
We won't attack if you do not run
We don't want to hurt you
Somehow I don't believe hi
I order you to come forward
You will receive a fair trial
Drop you weapons
And remain where you are
You got any ideas?
Drop your weapons
Surrounding them is out
Hell of a time for humor, John
Drop the weapons. Now!
You have no chance to escape!
Come forward
I wish to take you back alive
This is your last warning
The choice is yours
What do you say?
Fuck them!
If we're going, I wish we'd taken that bastard with us
What is that?
It's the rebels
Come on!
John, get out of there!
John!
You sure you don't want to stay?
You fight good for a tourist
Maybe next time
You want this back?
No. You keep it
Can you not stay?
I've got to go
Goodbye
Hard to believe, John
What's that, sir?
I hate to admit it, but the truth is,
I think we're getting soft
Maybe just a little, sir
Just a little
The story I want to tell you, can not be found in a book.
They say the history of the West was written from the saddle of a horse.
But it's never been told from the heart of one.
Not until now.
I was born here.
In this place that would come to be called the ''Old West''
But to my kind, the land was ageless.
It had no beginning and no end.
No boundary between earth and sky.
Like the wind in the Buffalo grass. We belong here.
We will always belong here.
They say the mustang is the spirit of the West.
Whether that West was won or lost in the end
You have to decide for yourself.
But the story I want to tell you is true.
I was there.
And I remember it.
I remember the sun, and the sky and the wind calling my name.
In the time when the wild horses ran free.
And so I grew from colt to stallion
As wild and reckless like thunder over the land.
Racing with the eagle.
Soaring with the wind.
Flying? There were times I believed I could.
Like my father before me
I became leader of the Cimarron herd.
And with that honour Came responsibllity.
Something new came upon the land one night.
Something that changed my life forever...
And so my journey began.
A wiser horse might have turned and ran.
But I wanted to know what strange creature was here.
What ...
Look
- Man, look at that stallion    - that is beautiful.
Follow the horse! Let's go!
Look out!
Don't you get away! mustang
I was scared.
I didn't know what was going to happen to me.
At least my mother and the herd were safe.
What seems to be the problem, gentlemen?
We got this crazy one here, Sir.
Really?
The army has dealt with wild horses before.
This one will be no different.
I remember the first time
I saw a rattler curled up in my path
-Induct this animal, Sargent.     -Yes Sir!
This one didn't look like a rattler.
But I was still thinking... snake.
Grab him, grab him.
Okay Murphy, he's all yours.
He's a wild one.
We'll see how wild he is, when I am done with him.
You want a fight, do you?
Right.
Make sure that's good tight.
Murphy, look out! Watch out!
Murphy, are you okay?
Corporal, round up some volunteers to take this animal to the stables.
Not the stables.       -Sir? -The corral.
It's time to break that horse.
-Sergent.      -Yes Sir.      -Tight this horse to the post.
No food or water. Three days.
Yes sir.
My heart galloped through the sky that night
Back to my herd. Where I belonged.
And I wonder if they'd miss me
As much as I miss them.
We got a hostile!
Bring him there this way.
Well，what have we have here?
We caught him by the supply wagon, Sir.
Ah, a Dakota.
Not as tall as the Cheyenne, and fine featured as the Crow.
Take him away gentlemen, show him our best.
Corporal, take him to the stock case.
Not the stock case. The post.
No food or water.
What are you looking at boy?
He was called Little Creak.
And he seemed different from the rest.
There were just no end to the strange ways of the two legged.
With the Colonel permission, Sir. Incoming patrol report hostiles headed North.
The railroad has expressed concern, Sir.
They requested additional patrols.
How long has it been, Sergent?
Sir?      -The mustang.
How long has it been tide?
Three days, Sir.
Good.
Fetch my crop and spurs.
Take it easy!
Back up! Back up!
You see gentlemen,  any horse can be broken.
Move along mustang.
There are those in Washington who believe the West will never be settled.
The northern pacific railroad will never breach Nebraska.
A hostile Dakota will never submit to providence.
And it is that manner of small thinking.
That would say this horse could never be broken.
Discipline,  time,  and patience.
Are the three great levelers.
Sometimes a horse's gotta do, what a horse's gotta do
And this was one of those times.
Get off me!
Soldier! Secure that horse!
I wasn't sure what happened back there.
And I wasn't about to stop and ask.
All I knew was I was headed home.
I couldn't believe it.
One moment I was free, and the next... more ropes.
I couldn't understand it.
She treated the scrawny two-legged
Like one of our kind.
Prancing around him Like a love struck ear ring.
It was down right unnatural.
Great mustang,
today I will ride you.
This ought to be good...
Mares.
Okay, Rain, lets see if you can teach This mustang some manners.
Okay, I admit it
She was charming In a stubborn, irritating kind of way.
So, I let her show me her world.
-Mr. Mills, how are you?  -I'm fine.
-How are you?  -Fine.
-I suppose you wanna see it again?  -Lf you don't mind.
-You know where it is.  -Oh, yeah.
If I charged you a dollar every time you came to examine the machine...
...you'd probably own it. It's the one all the pros use.
Mariah Carey. Beyonce. Gwen Stefani.
Really? Who's Beyonce?
Just kidding. I'll take it.
Excuse me, sir. The adult party's in the front.
-I'm Kim's father.  -Excuse me, I work for her father.
-Her real father.  -It's okay, Cyril. I got it.
-Hello, Bryan.  -Lenore.
I just wanted to give Kim her present.
We're letting the kids have their space.
-Put it with the others.  -I wanna give it to her myself.
-Still having trouble following the rules.  -Oh, come on, Lennie.
-I've asked you not to call me that.  -Excuse me. Lenore.
-Dad!  -Oh, my darling.
-Hi.  -Hello, my sweet.
-Happy birthday.  -I was telling your father...
...how we arranged the presents.  -Here.
It's bad manners to open the one...
...and not the others.  -Go on. Open it.
-Cool.  -A karaoke machine?
-Well, I figured she wants to be a singer.  -When she was 12, Bryan.
-We've moved on.  -Thank you, Daddy.
My pleasure.
-I still wanna be a singer. Don't tell Mom.  -You got it.
Here. One for the book.
-We have a professional photographer.  -Big smile, sweetie.
That's my girl.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my... Stuart!
Stuart, I love you! I love you! I love you!
Happy birthday, sweetie.
-Oh, Stuart, you're impossible.  -I know.
-Hey, Bryan.  -Stuart.
-She's not a little girl anymore, huh?  -I guess not.
-Will you join us for lunch?  -No, thanks.
I just wanted to be here to wish her a happy birthday.
-Good to see you, Bryan.  -You too.
Thanks.
-Hey.  -Hey.
You forgot.
Come on in.
It's not like I didn't call to remind you. Third Saturday in May?
-Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar?  -He probably had a lot on his mind.
Yeah, the busy life of a retiree. Every day a new adventure.
What does a retiree do, anyway? Take naps? Play golf?
-Hit on rich widows?  -That takes care of the morning.
Yeah, well, come on, guys. You know why I'm here.
Yeah, how's that going?
Okay. We had her birthday today.
Can you believe my Kimmy's 17?
Seventeen?
-To Kim.  -Lennie still got a hard-on for you?
She's not Lennie anymore. She's Lenore.
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.
-And the husband?  -The same. Perfect.
-Dig deep enough, there's always shit.  -We can dig if you want us to dig.
What, you think he hasn't done it already?
Thank you, Bernie.
-How's Kimmy?  -Good. She's good.
Yeah? She sleep over yet?
Well, let's say we're working on it.
She appreciate the fact that you've given up your life...
...in order to be closer to her?
What a life, huh?
Hey, remember Beirut after the chief disappeared?
Bry was in deep with that crazy sheik from Hezbollah?
The guy said he'd get us inside then disappeared.
We're scrambling to get the hell out...
...before we get taken down and where are you?
I promised never to miss her birthday.
Yeah, that went down well at Langley...
...when they found out you flew the coop...
...to attend your child's birthday 9000 miles away.
Where did you say your next posting was?
The Arctic Circle spying on penguins, I believe it was.
No, penguins live in Antarctica.
Actually, it was Alaska. What's your point, Sam?
My point is we have an open space. Say the word, it's yours.
Who likes theirs rare?
-Guys.  -See you, Bryan.
-Good night, guys.  -See you, Bry.
Hey, look, look, look. All kidding aside...
...it's a great thing trying to make up for lost time with Kimmy.
But tomorrow's job? Right here.
Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...
...just for taking some pop diva to and from her concert.
-We're one short.  -A singer?
I don't know if you'd call her a singer. More like a cash cow.
Twenty million records sold already and she's not even 25.
Job's a piece of cake.
We get her there and back. Inside, they've got their own people.
-Okay.  -Okay. Okay?
-Yeah.  -Like that's it?
Yeah.
-It'll be perfect. Just like old times.  -Better. No one gets killed.
-Tomorrow. Good night, guys.  -See you.
-Get in the back, Wendy.  -I always get in the back.
Ma'am, if you don't mind, I suggest you keep moving.
My mother is ma'am, if you don't mind.
-Come on, it's time now. Let's go.  -Okay.
Bernie, Casey, you're out here. Bry, you're in the room.
Okay.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Thank you for coming.
Wow, it was beautiful.
Thanks. What did you say your name was again?
Mills. Bryan Mills.
-Nice to meet you, Bryan Mills.  -You too.
-You're on. Come on, let's go now.  -Okay, guys.
Excuse me, miss.
I've a daughter who wants to be a singer and was wondering if you had any tips.
Yeah, I do.
Tell her to pick another career.
I got one. We're waiting on an air strike...
...and we're waiting and then my satellite phone rings.
-Who is it?  -Hello?
-The guy we're to terminate.  -Honey.
-He'd like to know if we want some tea.  -Sorry, guys, it's Kim.
The noise?
I'm at a concert.
You know this song? Yeah?
Yep, that's her. No, no, no, I'm not attending.
I'm... I'm not attending.
I'm helping some friends out with security.
Well, of course I met her.
Who do you think's guarding her?
I'm glad you're impressed.
Hey, I'm happy you called.
I'm happy you called. What?
Lunch? Tomorrow?
Sure, sure. I know the place.
Twelve-thirty it is.
I'll see you then.
-Here he is. And?  -What happened?
-She wants to have lunch.  -Okay.
-Just the two of us.  -All right. Fantastic.
See? There's progress. That's great.
Who left that gate open? Bry, get her out of here. Take the lead.
-Move!  -Go, go!
More security here now!
That's it. Move.
Casey!
Bernie, stand by, stand by.
-Go, go, go.  -Watch your head.
Here, take this. The sugar will take the edge off the shock.
Come on, come on, drink some more.
It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.
You're safe now.
Bernie.
Casey. Rambo.
Seriously, Bry, you should think about coming with us.
You've got the edge. There's more of this to be had.
-She's going to college next year?  -Yep.
-You're gonna lose her.  -That gives me a year to find her.
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.
-How are you feeling?  -Better.
So your daughter wants to be a singer?
Yep, since she was 5.
It's not what everyone thinks it is.
Once the glam wears off, it's just a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.
It's what she wants.
The first number is Gio, my vocal coach.
If he says she can sing, she can sing.
He'll give her coaching she needs, the fee is on me.
The second number is my manager.
If Gio clears her, he'll make sure she gets a shot.
-Thank you.  -No, Mr. Mills, thank you.
-There she is.  -Dad.
-Hi, sweetie.  -Hey.
-Hi.  -Hi.
Don't look so excited.
I was just surprised. I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.
I asked Mom to come.
One raspberry-banana milkshake, extra cherries, just the way you like it.
-Thanks.  -Lennie... Lenore.
-Would you like something?  -I'm fine, thanks.
So?
So, Dad, guess what.
-You know my friend Amanda?  -Yep.
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation with them in Paris.
How cool is that?
-Why do you want to go to Paris?  -Dad. Hello?
The Louvre, the lmpressionist museum, the Picasso Museum.
I didn't know you were so into art.
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA, like, a hundred times.
Amanda went last summer, she came back, she could practically speak French.
And because you're under 18...
...you need my permission to leave the country?
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.
They've got this sick apartment overlooking the river.
-Just you and Amanda?  -And her cousins.
Don't make a big deal out of this, Bryan. Just sign the paper.
-What?  -I'm not comfortable with this.
-Dad.  -I know the world, sweetie.
-Dad, please.  -A 17-year-old should not travel alone.
-I'm not gonna be alone.  -Two 17-year-olds.
Amanda's 19.
How about this? How about if I go along?
You won't know I'm there. I'm very good at being invisible.
As you so amply demonstrated for most of her life.
Just sign the paper, Bryan.
I'll think about it.
Everyone at this table knows what that means.
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.
-I don't want anything else.  -Kim.
-I don't get you.  -What?
You sacrificed our marriage in the service of the country.
You made a mess of your life in service of your country.
Can't you sacrifice a little this time for your daughter?
-I would sacrifice anything for her.  -What's your problem?
I'm not comfortable putting my daughter at risk.
Putting our daughter at risk by going to Paris?
You're pathetic.
-She's coming.  -Thanks.
Three conditions.
The address and phone number of where you're staying.
You move, I wanna know where and with whom you'll be staying.
Call me when you land. Call me every night before you go to sleep.
It's international. My number is in.
-Okay, awesome.  -Kimmy, you're not focused.
-I am.  -What did I say?
You said call you when I land, every night before I go to sleep...
...your phone's international, the number's programmed in.
Okay, one last thing. I get to take you to the airport.
Okay.
-There you go.  -Yes.
Thank you, Daddy. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Mom!
I love you, Dad.
Mom, he signed it, he signed it. I'm gonna go call Amanda!
Wouldn't it have been easier to sign the first time?
Wouldn't it have been easier if you and I had talked about it first?
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid. I've written them down.
-Dad.  -Come on, take it.
We're gonna be spending 90 percent of our time in museums. Don't worry.
That's like telling water not to be wet, sweetie.
Mom says your job made you paranoid.
Well, my job made me aware.
I used to ask Mom what your job was that you were away all the time.
And she would tell me to ask you.
Whenever I did see you, I was afraid to ask.
Yeah? Why?
I don't know. Maybe because...
...I was afraid to find out.
Like, maybe it was something I wouldn't like.
I worked for the government. You knew that.
So you were like a spy, right?
-What happens if I push this button?  -Don't touch that button.
Well, no, I was a... I was a preventer, actually.
-A preventer?  -Yeah.
What did you prevent?
Bad things from happening.
So it was a good job?
Yes. Yep, it was.
Do you miss it?
I missed you more.
-Kim!  -Dad, there's Amanda.
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.
-Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.  -I can manage.
Lenore.
Do you know about this? She's not just going to Paris.
-I know.  -She lied to me.
Yes, because she can't be honest with you.
Why? What are you talking about?
Your rules and conditions.
What is this?
It's U2's European tour dates.
She's following a rock band around Europe?
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.
Best hotels. You know, you live in your little bubble here...
...behind your wall, with your maids and chauffeurs and servants.
No idea what the world is like.
Yes, and neither will she unless she goes out and experiences it.
Don't tell me I don't know the world.
For five years I waited for a phone call that didn't come for weeks at a time.
For a knock on the door telling me there'd be no calls anymore.
Listen, I know you moved here to build some sort of relationship with Kimmy.
But you're not gonna do that by smothering her.
Let her live, or I promise, I promise you'll lose her.
Girls.
Kim!
I love you.
Let's go. Come on.
I'll teach you the French words I know.
-Which may not be that much, but...  -Okay. Yeah, right.
Three. Okay, now take one...
Need some help? One with the two of you?
Yes, please.
-Okay.  -He's really cute.
Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.
Where are you from?
California.
No. I'm Peter.
-This is Kim.  -Hi.
-Nice to meet you.  -Hi.
Hey.
You're going into Paris?
You know, taxis here are so damned expensive.
Want to share?
-Yeah. Sure.  -Okay, perfect.
Thanks.
To check arrivals, please press one.
Please enter the flight number.
Flight 288 arrived in Paris Charles de Gaulle...
...at 8 a.m. Local time.
Yeah.
Oh, are you serious?
-Oh, my God.  -Nice address.
Oh, yeah, thanks.
It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid
so we have the whole place to ourselves.
How cool is that?
-I didn't know that.  -It's no biggie.
Well, I have to be going.
-Nice to meet you.  -Oh, okay.
-You too.  -Bye.
Hey.
There is a party tonight at school. Want to come?
-Sure. Yeah.  -We don't even know him.
What is there to know? He's hot.
-I come pick you up around 9?  -Okay, yeah.
Okay, great. Your apartment?
-It's the whole fifth floor. Hoffmann.  -Okay. See you tonight. Bye.
Bye.
Yeah.
Fifth floor.
Two girls around 18.
Oh, my God.
-How sick is this?  -Are you kidding me? It's great.
I just wish you would've told me they weren't gonna be here.
-What's the difference?  -I told my dad they'd be here.
You told your dad you were going to museums too.
Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.
-I'm gonna sleep with him.  -Who?
-Peter.  -You just met him.
I hear French guys are amazing in bed.
-Maybe he has a friend, huh?  -No.
-No.  -Oh, come on.
You gotta lose it sometime. Might as well be in Paris.
Hey!
-Amanda, where's the bathroom?  -What?
I have to pee!
-Hello?  -It's me. Has Kim called you?
Bryan, she's 17. She's in Paris. Give her some space.
She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.
Have a drink or something. Good night.
Good night.
Hi, Daddy.
Kim.
What did I say? You were supposed to call me.
I'm sorry.
I thought something was wrong with the phone.
-No. It was such a rush at the airport.  -All right.
Well, if I'd had the number where you were staying...
...I would've just called there.
What's the number?
-I don't have it.  -Kimmy, come on.
This is one of the conditions. Let me talk to the cousins.
I'll get it from them.
Dad, they're in Spain. I didn't know. I swear.
To Spain?
Kim, is there anything else you want to tell me?
Kimmy.
-There's someone here.  -The cousins are back?
No.
-Oh, my God. They got Amanda.  -What?
What are you talking about? Kimmy?
-Dad.  -Kim.
-Kim.  -Dad. They took her.
-They took her.  -All right, listen to me.
Oh, God.
-Did you meet anyone on the plane?  -No.
-In the airport?  -No. Yes, Peter.
-Peter? Peter who?  -I don't know.
-An American?  -No.
Did he know where you were staying?
He took a cab with us.
Dad, they're coming.
-Please, I'm scared.  -I know you are.
Stay focused, Kimmy. You have to hold it together.
How many people are there?
-Three, four. I don't know.  -Where are you?
-I'm in the bathroom.  -Go to the next bedroom.
Get under the bed. Tell me when you're there.
-I'm here.  -Now, the next part is very important.
They are going to take you. Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.
You will have five, maybe ten seconds. Very important seconds.
Leave the phone on the floor. Concentrate.
Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.
Anything you see. You understand?
They're there. I can hear them.
Remember, concentrate.
Put the phone closer so I can hear.
They're leaving. I think they're...
Beard. Six feet. Tattoo right hand, moon and star.
I don't know who you are.
I don't know what you want.
If you are looking for a ransom, I can tell you, I don't have money.
But what I do have are a very particular set of skills.
Skills I've acquired over a very long career.
Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.
If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it.
I will not look for you. I will not pursue you.
But if you don't, I will look for you.
I will find you...
...and I will kill you.
Good luck.
Sam, it's me. I need a favor.
I'm gonna download something. I need it analyzed. Right now.
-She's been taken.  -What?
-Any enemies overseas?  -Why would I have enemies?
You do business overseas through multiple shell corporations.
You were involved in an oil deal with a bunch of Russians that went south.
-How do you know that?  -I was not gonna let my daughter...
...live with someone without knowing everything about them.
-I have a few resources...  -Now is not the time for dick measuring.
-Anyone looking to hurt you?  -Not that I know.
-Which room's Kim's?  -What happened?
I got a call from her. There were people in the apartment. She was taken.
-Oh, God.  -Which one?
That one.
Is there something I should be doing?
You have a lease agreement with NetJet through your company.
I do.
-Get me a plane to Paris.  -For when?
An hour ago.
-I'm gonna make the call. You all right?  -Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.
Would you please get her back to me, Bryan?
First I have to find her.
Sam, what have you got?
They're speaking Albanian.
Based on their accents and dialects, they must be from Tropoja.
The place is ground zero for scummers.
Even the Russians give these guys a wide berth.
The one you spoke to, his name is Marko.
We have information that a mobster boss...
...by the name of Marko Hoxha moved to Paris about six months ago.
If he's the one, he's a big fish. The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.
-Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?  -Lenore is here.
-Hey, Lennie.  -Hello, Sam.
She needs to hear it, Sam.
The specialty of the groups coming out of this area is trafficking in women.
-Keep going.  -Okay.
Their previous m.o.
Was to offer women from emerging East European countries...
...like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria
jobs in the West as maids and nannies.
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.
Lately, however, they've decided that it's more economical...
...just to kidnap traveling young women. Saves on transportation costs.
Oh, my little baby.
What else?
Based on the way these groups operate, our analyst says...
...you have a 96-hour window from the time she was grabbed.
-To what?  -To never finding her.
No, no, no.
Daddy!
Mustache. Six feet. Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.
Da...
Good luck.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Oh, my God.
Dad, they got Amanda.
Oh, God.
Dad, they got her.
They took her.
Go to the next bedroom. Get under the bed.
-Tell me when you're there.  -I'm here.
Stay focused, baby. Leave the phone on the floor.
Concentrate. Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars. Anything you see. You understand?
They're there. I can hear them. Remember, concentrate.
They're leaving. Daddy!
Dad!
Beard. Six feet. Tattoo right hand, moon and star.
Dad!
-Hi.  -Hi.
-I'm Peter.  -I'm Ingrid.
-On holidays?  -Yes.
-Me too.  -Cool.
Cabs here are so damned expensive. Want to share?
-Sure. Why not?  -Great.
-Excuse me.  -Hey.
-Hey.  -Drive.
-The two American girls from yesterday?  -I don't know.
The next rib drives into your lungs. The two American girls, where are they?
-Just like the old days.  -Would you have it any other way?
Between you and me? No.
But now that I sit behind a desk, the world looks different.
-You mean, looks boring.  -I mean different.
Okay, a little boring. But is being retired any more interesting?
It wasn't. Until my daughter disappeared in Paris yesterday.
She and her friend were marked by a spotter at the airport
Albanians took her.
-How do you know this?  -I'm retired, not dead.
And I assume you don't want to go to the police.
I was told I have 96 hours. That was 16 hours ago.
-Okay, first, we should find the spotter.  -I found him, he's dead.
You found him that way?
Bryan, you cannot just run around tearing down Paris...
I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to.
-Don't forget who you talk to.  -I'm talking to a friend.
You are. But please remember, your friend has a desk now.
"Deputy director, Internal Security." Very impressive.
The Albanians?
They showed up from the East, six, seven years ago.
Fifteen, 20 of them. Now there are hundreds.
We don't even know how many. And dangerous.
So I heard. Where do I find them?
The best place to start is Porte de Clichy. Bryan, try not to make a mess.
-Gregor Milocivic?  -Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.
I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.
Here is my resume.
The employment agency said we would be doing translations.
Yes. Albanian to English
You do speak Albanian?
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian
I was a teacher in primary school...
...before the war began in Pristina...  -What's your rate?
My rate?
It is 25 per hour for the first three hours and then it goes up...
Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours. Wait here.
Mr. Smith, I do not understand. What is the job exactly?
Right now the job is to wait here.
Good evening.
-Hi. Looking for a date?  -I love your dress. Is that silk?
I don't know. You want to know the prices?
Just the way it falls, it must be silk.
How it compliments the natural curves of your body.
The rate is 40 euros for the standard.
Standard? Could you be more specific?
Back home, the standard covers a range of possibilities.
Like kissing, you know, closed lips, open lips.
-Lf you're not buying, piss off.  -I didn't say I wasn't buying.
I like to get comfortable before I purchase.
Like this karaoke machine I bought.
I must have read that manual from cover to cover so many times.
I don't give a shit. You're gonna get me in trouble if you don't buy.
-Trouble? Really? With who?  -Piss off.
Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.
If I want a package deal, do I get a discount?
-You cost me two now.  -My name's Bryan.
-Oh, God. You better leave.  -I thought we were negotiating.
Anton, I swear, it's not my fault.
-I told him...  -Why are you bothering the girl?
-None of your business.  -She is my business.
And if you're not spending money, you're costing money.
-I was negotiating.  -No negotiating. Price is the price.
Now you owe me for two that got away.
I don't owe you nothing.
-Fifty euros or I kick your ass.  -Sure, sure, okay.
Chill.
Okay. Here's your 50.
And another 50 for being an asshole. Now get the hell out of here.
If I see you again, I'll kill you.
Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of job I'm supposed to do for you, but...
-You are to translate.  -Yes. But translate what?
This.
Translate.
-They're talking about you.  -What about me?
-They're not saying nice things.  -Be specific.
They're saying... Excuse me, Mr. Smith.  -What an asshole you are.
Please, if you can explain to me why we're doing this...
Just translate.
One of them says, the sausage gave him heartburn.
Keep going.
The other one is suggesting something his grandmother used to give him.
-Do you really want to hear all this?  -Every word.
Now they're talking about football. The game between Lazio and Marseille.
And they lost money on the betting.
-Perhaps if I knew the purpose...  -You're better off not knowing.
Is it still football?
One is on the phone.
He has to do a job at the construction site.
Something about fresh merchandise giving problems.
Mr. Smith, I do not understand any of this.
You're not supposed to. Goodbye.
I asked for an English-Albanian dictionary, did you bring one?
Thank you.
I love you.
Where did you get this?
Where did you get this?
-I'm good.  -Who gave this to you?
-Who...? Who gave this to you?  -I'm good.
Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
Monsieur Allen, how are you?
Hello, Gilles. How's the wife?
Well, still in charge.
-Been a long time since I've seen you.  -Way too long.
-The usual accommodation?  -Plus one.
Yes?
-We need to talk.  -I'm listening.
Well, can't you come and meet me first?
I can't see you. Where are you?
I can see you and hear you very well.
You can tell them to stop jogging now.
Didn't think I was gonna come down, did you?
I didn't think you were gonna make such a mess.
I didn't have time to worry about neatness.
-I know. You have 70 hours.  -Now I have 56.
No, now you have none.
My chief wanted to arrest you, I convinced him to send you home.
Air France 001 leaves today at 2. First class.
Courtesy of the French government for past services rendered.
-And what about my daughter?  -I told you, I sit behind a desk now.
I take my orders from someone who sits behind a bigger desk.
Come on, seven dead bodies, three in hospital, a building destroyed.
Total chaos at the airport.
He wanted your ass in chains. It's the best I could do, I'm sorry.
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-Claude. Not this time.
You can't beat the state, Bryan. You know that.
I'm not trying to. I'm trying to save my daughter.
It was a trailer, not a building.
No, no, no. Leave it.
It's all right, it's fluids.
And medication to counteract the drugs.
It's all right.
Where'd you get this?
Where did you get this jacket?
Did you get it from her?
Was it from this girl?
I didn't steal it.
-I was cold, she gave it to me.  -Where? Where did she give it to you?
-In the house.  -What house?
The house with the red door.
Sorry.
He said it was a party.
The girl who gave you this, was she in the house?
She was nice.
I know.
She's my daughter.
I need to find this house. Do you know where it is?
Paradise.
-Good morning.  -May I help you?
-I'm here to see your boss.  -No boss.
We're doing nothing wrong here.
One button, and 30 agents will be here...
...before you have time to scratch your balls.
Stop jerking around before I close you down for wasting my time.
Wait here.
You have weapon?
You're holding it.
Black, one sugar, please.
What is it you want?
I'm here to negotiate the rates.
We already negotiated the rate with Mr. Macon.
Mr. Macon has moved to another division.
I'm here for the renegotiation.
Unless you think I'm being unreasonable, let me explain ourselves.
Nice coffee. We have you under satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.
We hear everything you say, we know everything you do.
Do you have any idea what it costs just to change the angle...
...of the lens on a satellite orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?
And those costs have gone up.
Our costs go up, your costs go up. It's only logical.
By the way, which one of you is Marko?
Why do you want to know?
I was told Marko is in charge.
We are all Marko.
Marko from Tropoja.
We are all from Tropoja.
If that's the game you want to play, the rate just went up 10 percent.
If you are trying to extort us because we are immigrants, we know the law.
I'm extorting you because you are breaking the law.
Which charge would you like to be arrested for?
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution? Take your pick.
You come to this country, take advantage of it...
...and think because we are tolerant, we are weak and helpless.
Your arrogance offends me.
For that, the rate went up 10 percent.
Now, do you want to get down to business or to keep playing?
-How much?  -Twenty percent.
And you have my word it'll not go up for a year.
How do you say "sugar" in your language?
You've made a very good investment, gentlemen.
See you in a month.
A friend gave this to me. It's Albanian. You mind translating it?
Good luck.
-Good luck.  -Good luck.
-Good luck. Good luck.  -Good luck.
You don't remember me.
We spoke on the phone two days ago.
I told you I would find you.
Kim.
Amanda.
Wake up!
I need you to be focused.
Are you focused yet?
Where is this girl?
Where is she?
You know, we used to outsource this kind of thing.
But what we found was the countries we outsourced to...
...had unreliable power grids. Very Third World.
You'd turn on a switch, power wouldn't come on...
...and then tempers would get short
People would resort to pulling fingernails.
Acid drips on bare skin.
The whole exercise would become counterproductive.
But here, the power's stable.
Here, there's a nice even flow.
Here, you can flip a switch and the power stays on all day.
Where is she?
Now, I don't have any more time to waste, Marko from Tropoja.
Give me what I need or this switch'll stay on...
...till they turn power off for lack of payment on the bill.
Where is my daughter?
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.
She was virgin, lot of money.
You sold my daughter? You sold her?
To who?
I don't know.
-What?  -Saint-Clair.
Saint-Clair.
Saint-Clair? Saint-Clair. Is that a person, a place?
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.
Patrice Saint-Clair.
Where can I find him?
I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Please! I don't know!
I don't know! No! Please! Please.
Please.
Not that. Please.
I believe you.
But it's not gonna save you.
Look who dropped by.
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.
Jean-Claude.
The children waited up for you.
If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat before everything gets cold.
Bryan, will you do the honors?
-Sure.  -I'll be just a minute.
I was just telling Bryan how nice it's been...
...since you left the old job for the new one.
Home every night for dinner, get to see the kids more.
Yeah, must be nice coming home every night, seeing your kids.
Bryan has been thinking about relocating.
-Really?  -Yes.
To Paris, he's been visiting houses.
-White or dark meat?  -Dark, please.
Find anything interesting?
As a matter of fact, I did, in the 10th arrondissement on Rue Paradis.
People there know someone that works in your office.
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?
Oh, Henry. I call him Mr. Nervous.
Always seems like he's about to have a problem. Carrots?
I got to the bottom of it, Jean-Claude.
I know everything.
I hope you're not involved in this shit.
-What shit?  -This is not the time or place, Bryan.
-Are you involved?  -Involved in what?
What are you two talking about?
-Are you?  -My salary is X, my expenses are Y.
As long as my family is provided for...
...I do not care where the difference comes from.
That is my entire involvement.
-What about my family?  -I told you...
...I would help as long as it didn't cause trouble.
Who is Patrice Saint-Clair?
I don't know, I don't care. I am driving you to the airport.
Jean-Claude.
Let's get going. Dinner is over.
-I'm not finished yet.  -Yes, you are.
-No!  -No, I'm not.
That's what happens when you sit behind a desk. You forget things.
Like the weight in the hand of a gun that's loaded.
Isabelle!
It's a flesh wound.
But if you don't get me what I need, the last thing you'll see...
...is the bullet I put between her eyes.
Now, Patrice Saint-Clair.
You could've made this less painful...
...if you had been more concerned about my daughter and less about your desk.
Please apologize to your wife for me.
-Can I help you?  -Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Saint-Clair.
Your name, please.
I'm sorry, your name is not on the list.
Oh, please check again.
Inside.
May I help you, sir?
-Your champagne.  -Yeah, I will take it.
I have 50,000. Fifty thousand.
Fifty thousand.
One hundred, 100,000.
One hundred, 150.
I have 150.
Your champagne, sir.
Two, I have two, 250.
May I serve?
-Please.  -I have 250.
Two-fifty.
Sold for 250,000.
The last item.
As usual, we save the best for last.
Speaks English, some French.
Certified pure.
-Sorry.  -Get out.
The bidding will begin at 100,000.
One hundred.
One hundred thousand.
-I said...  -I heard what you said.
Buy her.
I have 100.
-Buy her.  -One-fifty.
Two hundred.
Two-fifty, three, 350.
Three hundred and fifty thousand.
Four. Four.
Four-fifty, 450.
Four hundred and fifty thousand.
Four-fifty.
Five hundred. Five hundred thousand.
Five hundred thousand. Sold.
That concludes the sales for tonight. Thank you all for coming.
-You can collect your purchases directly.  -Move.
You will never get away with this
Lf you wanna live, you'll make sure I do.
Now, Mr?
Well, we know you're not this man. So, what do we call you?
It doesn't matter what we call you...
...what does matter is what you're doing here.
The last girl, I'm her father.
-Oh, my.  -Give her to me.
I wish I could, honestly.
See, I'm a father myself.
I have two sons and a daughter...
...but let me tell you something, Mr. Whoever-You-Are.
This is a business.
This is a very unique business...
...with a very unique clientele.  -I'll pay.
In this business, you have no refunds, returns...
...discounts, buybacks. All sales are final.
Besides discretion, it's about the only rule we have.
Kill him. Quietly. I have guests.
Would you please go see which part of "quietly"...
...they did not understand?  -Yes, sir.
Okay, we can resolve this. I know how you feel.
We should talk, okay? We can work this out.
You have no idea...
-Where is she?  -Please.
Understand. Please try...
There's a boat by the quay.
Please understand.
It was all business, it wasn't personal.
It was all personal to me.
We can...
-Daddy.  -Kim.
You came for me.
You came for me.
I told you I would.
May I have your attention. If you're waiting for oversized bags...
Mom.
Oh, my God.
Oh, sweetie.
Oh, here, let me get that for you.
Bryan, if there's anything you need...
I've got everything I need.
I love you so much.
Stuart.
Thank you.
Attention, travelers. You are not required to...
Shall we go?
Sure you don't wanna ride with us?
-I'll be fine. I'll take a cab. Thanks.  -All right.
-I love you, Dad.  -Love you too.
-Where are we?  -I told you. It's a surprise.
-Hi.  -Hi.
When someone says "hi," it's usually polite to say "hi" back.
Hi.
I heard you wanna be a singer.
-I do.  -She does.
Well, come on in. Let's see what you got.
LOS ANGELES 2029 A.D.

You can go pump or auto.
The 45 long slide with laser sighting.
These are new. We just got them in. That's a good gun.
The beam comes on,you put the red dot where you want the bullet to go.
You can't miss.
Anything else?

The Uzi nine millimetre.
You know your weapons, buddy.Any one of these is ideal for home defence.
So which

It's a 15-day wait on the handguns, but the rifles you can take now.
You can't do that.
Wrong.
Hi, baby.

Once again, Sarah Connor, 35, mother of two,
brutally shot to death this afternoon.
You're dead, honey.

for the greatest sound around, come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.
We've got woofers, tweeters, the newest in audio and compact discs.
We've got graphic equalisers and sound balancers that
Sorry.
Hello?
First I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse one by one,
then run my tongue down your neck to your bare, gleaming breasts.
And then slowly
slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch.
Ginger, it's Matt.
And lick your belly in circles further
and further down,
and then pull your
panties off with my teeth.
Who is this?
God. Sarah?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
I thought you were...Can I talk to Ginger?
I'll live.
It's the creep.
First I'll rip the buttons off your blouse one by one...
You fucking pigs.

-What's this?  -Dead girl two.
Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon.
Are you sure there's a point to all of this?
Look at the name, Ed.
Sarah
Connor.Is this right?
You're kidding.
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.
-A one-day pattern killer.
-I hate the weird ones.
So...
Better than mortal man deserves.
-Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?  -Not lately.
-Did you check messages?  -I thought you did.
-Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
-There you are, young man.
You mind your mother.
Bye
Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.Looks like I won't be able to make it tonight.
Just can't get out of it.
I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.
Call you in a day or so. Bye.
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?
He can't treat you like this. It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.
I'll live.
I'll break his kneecaps.
Well, Pugsley still loves me. Don't you, baby?
God. It's disgusting.
-I'm gonna go to a movie,
kiddo.  -Have a good time.
-We will. You, too.  -OK.
Damn it, Matt.
Shit.
These killings occurred in the order of their listings in the phone book.
-What can I tell you? No comment. -But, Lieutenant...
-But, Lieutenant...
That coffee's two hours cold.
I put a cigarette out in it.
-Did you reach the next girl yet? -No. I got her answering machine.
-Send a unit.  -I sent a unit.
There's no answer.-The apartment manager's not in.
-Call her.-I just called her.
-Call her again.
Give me a cigarette.
Hi,
there. Fooled you. You're talking to a machine.
But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need love,
so talk to it...and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you. Wait for the beep.
Same shit.
I can hear it now. He's gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.
-Where are you going?
-To make a statement.Maybe make these jackals work for us.
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,
maybe she'll call us.
Well,
how do I look?-Like shit, boss.
-Your mama.
This just in.
Police have announced the name of the victim
in the second of two murders which took place today.
Incredibly, the names of the two victims are virtually identical.
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor was pronounced dead...
-Can we
change this?  -Sarah Louise...
Don't touch it.
murdered earlier today in her home.
Police are refusing to speculate
on the similarity between the shooting deaths
and no other connection between the two victims has been established yet.
We'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in.

-Hey, you got a phone?  -It's in the back.
Hey. Four-fifty.
You have reached the Los Angeles Police emergency number.
All lines are busy.
If you need a police car sent out to you, stay on the line.
Go on.
I'm gonna make a belt out of you.
Don't make me bust you up, man.
Hi,
there. Fooled you. You're talking to a machine.
But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need love, too.
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.
Ginger. This is Sarah. Pick up if you're there.
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir.
I think that there's somebody after me.
I'm really scared.
I hope that you play this back soon.
I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible.
The police keep transferring me. I'm gonna give 'em another try.
The number here is 5559175.
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.
-Sarah Connor?
It's her.
-Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.  -Listen...
Don't put me on hold. Don't transfer me to another department.
-I won't. -where you are?-I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
-I know it. It's on Pico.-Are you all right?
-Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.-I think there's a guy following me.
-Now, listen carefully.You're in a public place so you'll be safe.
Stay visible. Don't go outside.
-I'll have a car there in a minute.  -OK.
Hey, that guy didn't pay.
Come with me if you wanna live.
Come on!
This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.
Suspect vehicle -Iate model grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.
He's really moving -punching lights.
I'm gonna need an ambulance at Seventh and Broadway right now.
Hold it.
Are you injured?
Are you shot?
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.
Exactly.
Hold on.
Don't make a sound unless I say.
Do you understand?
-Do you understand?  -Yes.
Please don't hurt me.
I'm here to help you.
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.
You've been targeted for termination.
Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.
This is one-L19. Westbound on Olympic. Approaching Overland.
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.
This isn't true. How could that man just get up after you...
It's not a man.
A machine. A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101 .
A machine.
Like a robot?
Not a robot.
A cyborg-cybernetic organism.
-No. He was bleeding.
-Just a second.
Get your head down.
Listen.?
The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis.Microprocessor controlled.
Outside it's living human tissue.
Flesh, skin, hair, blood  grown for the cyborgs.
-Look, Reese, I don't know  -Pay attention.
I gotta ditch this car.
The 600-Series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.
But these are new. They look human.
Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot.
I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him.
Look,
I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.
Not yet.
Not for about forty years.
Are you saying it's from the future?
from your point of view.
I don't know tech stuff.
Then you're from the future, too.
-Right
-Right
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.
-Just let me go. -Listen
and understand.
That Terminator is out there.
It can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear
and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.
and it absolutely will not stop,
ever
until you are dead.
Can you stop it?
I don't know.
With these weapons, I don't know.
All units.Ford suspect vehicle has been found in a parking structure
been found in a parking structure
at Fourth and Beaudry.
Reese,
why me?
Why does it want me?
A few years from now,
There was a nuclear war.
this whole place,
all this,  everything,
it's gone,
just gone.
There were survivors.
Nobody even knew who started it.
-It was the machines,
-I don't understand.
New, powerful,
Defence network computers.
hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.
They say it got smart,
a new order of intelligence.
Then it saw all people as a threat.
It decided our fate in a microsecond.
Extermination.
Did you see this war?
No.
I grew up after. In the ruins.
In the ruins.Starving.
haphazard
Hiding from the H-Ks.
-H-Ks?  -Hunter killers.
Patrol machines built in automated factories.
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.
This was burned in by laser scanner.
Some of us were kept alive.
Loading bodies.
To work.
The disposal units ran night and day.
We were that close to going out for ever.
But there was one man
To storm the wire of the camps.To smash those metal mother fuckers into junk.
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.
His name was Connor.
John Connor.
Your son,
Your unborn son.
Drive.
Reese!
No, Reese. No,
no. They'll kill you.
You in the Cadillac, let me see your hands now.
Get out of the car.
Drop to your knees.
-Out of the car
-Drop to the ground.
Sarah.
try to drink some of this.
are you sure it's them?
I mean, maybe I should look at the bodies.
No. They've been identified and there's no doubt.
A god
Ginger.
Kiddo.
-Sarah,
this is Dr Silberman.
-Hi, Sarah.
Tell him everything Reese told you, Sarah.
Do you feel up to that?Yeah, I guess so.
-You're a doctor?
-Criminal psychologist.
-Is Reese crazy?
-That's what we're gonna find out.
So you're a soldier.
Fighting for whom?
From '21 to '27.
With the 132nd under Perry.
That's the
year 2027?
That's right.
Then I was assigned...-This is fucking great.
-under John Connor.
-Who was the enemy? -A computer defence system...
Goddamn! Sorry.
built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems.
I see.
And this computer thinks .
it can win by killing the mother of its enemy
Killing him, in effect, before he's even conceived.
A sort of retroactive abortion?
Silberman cracks me up. Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.
Why didn't the computer just kill Connor then?
It had no choice.
Their defence grid was smashed.
We'd won.
Taking out Connor then would make no difference.
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence.
Is that when you captured the lab complex and found...
The time displacement equipment?
That's right.
The Terminator had already gone through.
Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place.
Well, how are you supposed to get back?
I can't.
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.
It's just
him and me.
It's just
and me.
Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.
Don't you have ray guns?
-Ray guns
-Show me a piece of future technology.
You go naked. .
Something about the field generated by a living organism
Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
OK, OK. But this cyborg, if it's metal...?
-Surrounded by living tissue.
-Oh, right.
Great stuff. I could make a career out of this guy.
See how clever it is? It doesn't require a shred of proof.
Most paranoid delusions are intricate, but this is brilliant.
-Why were the other women killed?
-Records were lost in the war.
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.
Her full name, where she lived. They just knew the city.
The Terminator was just being systematic.
-Let's go back...
-Look, you have heard enough.
I have answered your questions. I have to see Sarah Connor.
-I'm afraid that's not up to me.
-Then why am I talking to you?
-Who is in authority here?  -Please...
Shut up!
You still don't get it, do you?
He'll find her.
That's what he does.
That's all he does.
You can't stop him.
He'll reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out!
-Doc.
-Let go of me!
Sorry.
Ress! He's crazy?
In technical terminology,
he's a loon.
Sarah, this is what they call body armour.
Our TAC guys wear these.
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.This other man must've been wearing one under his coat.
Feel that.
-He punched through the windshield.
-He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand. He wouldn't feel it.
-There was this guy once...You see this scar?  -Here.
Thank you.
There's a couch in this other room. Stretch out and get some sleep.
Be at least an hour before your mother gets here.
-I can't sleep.
-Try.
It may not look it, but that couch is very comfortable.
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.
Thank you.
-Good night.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.I was told she's here.
Could I see her?No. Can't see her. She's making a statement.
Where is she?
It make take a while.If you wanna wait, there's a bench over there.
I'll be back.
What the hell was that?
Gunshot!
-What is it, terrorists?  -Let's go
Stay here.
-Let's get out of here! -Come on!
Move it,
I got him
Watch him.
- Automatic weapons!  -Lock and load! Let's go!
Ed
Ed
Sarah!
Reese.
This way.
KFLB news time. 4.36.
Top story,
the largest single law enforcement mobilisation
in California history is currently underway.
Police in five counties are engaged in a massive manhunt for...
Take this.
All right. Let's get this off the road.
-You cold?
-Freezing.
Reese?
-You got a first name?
-Kyle.
-Kyle.
what's it like when you go through time?
White light.
White light.
-It's like being born maybe.
-My God.
I caught one back there.
-You mean you got shot?
-It's not bad.
-We gotta get you to a doctor.  -It's OK. Forget it.
What do you mean, forget it?Are you crazy?
Take this off.
Jesus.
See? It passed right through the meat.
This is gonna make me puke.
-Would you just talk about something?  -What?
I don't know. Anything. Just talk.
Tell me about my son.
He's about my height.
He has your eyes.
What's he like?
You trust him.
He's got a strength.
I'd die for John Connor.
Well, at least now I know what to name him.
Don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost?
John never said much about him.
-I know he dies before the war...  -Wait.
I don't wanna know.
So was it John that sent you here?
I volunteered.
-Why?
-It was a chance to meet the legend.
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organise,
prepare
prepare from when he was a kid.
When you were in hiding before the war.
You're talking about things I haven't done yet in the past tense.
It's driving me crazy.
Are you sure you have the right person?
I'm sure.
Come on! Do I look like the mother of the future?
I mean, am I tough?
I can't even balance my chequebook.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honour and I don't want it.
Any of it.
Your son gave me a message to give to you.
. Made me memorise it.
Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years.
I can't help you with what you must soon face. The future is not set.
You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.
You must survive or I will never exist.
That's all.
It's a good field dressing.
You like it?
It's my first.
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.
OK.
Talk to me some more.
About what?
Tell me about where you're from.
All right.
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.
You still have to be careful because the H-Ks use infrared.
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.
That's when the infiltrators started to appear.
The Terminators were the newest. The worst.
Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 metres north ofyour position.
Let's go.
-Reese. DN384...
-Right. Let him in.
We're cutting short the patrol. Over
Roger, Yankee-1-7.You are clear to return.
Terminator!
I was dreaming about dogs.
We use 'em to spot Terminators.
Your world is pretty terrifying.
Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there or what?
Fuck you, asshole.
Fuck you, asshole.
God damn.
Thank you.
-Tiki Motel.
Is this enough?
Yeah, it's enough. I don't wanna ask where you got it.
-I'm coming.  -We need a room.
-Ok.  -With a kitchen.
Do you have one with a kitchen?
I am dying for a shower.
We should check your bandage, too.
Later. I'm going out for supplies.
Keep this.
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom. I was told not to say.
I need to know where to reach you.
You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?
I am worried sick here.
OK. OK,
here's the number.
-You ready?  -Yes. Go ahead.
Room nine.
-Got it?  -I've got it.
I gotta go. I'm sorry I can't tell you more right now.
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, sweetheart.
-Tiki Motel.  -Give me your address there.
What have we got?
Mothballs...
corn syrup...
ammonia.
What's for dinner?
-Plastique.  -That sounds good.
What is it?
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.I learned to make it when I was a kid.
Make sure there's none on the threads.
Like this.
Screw the end cap on.
Very gently.
You must've had a fun childhood.
That's good.
Six more like that and I'll get started on the fuses.
He'll find us, won't he?
Probably.
It'll never be over, will it?
Look at me. I'm shaking.
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.
No,
No, I'm not.
Kyle,
the women in your time,
what are they like?
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant.
Was there someone special?
Someone...?
you know.
No.
Never.
Never?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
So much pain.
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.
So you feel nothing?
John Connor gave me a picture of you once.
I didn't know why at the time.
It was very old,
torn,
faded.
You were young like you are now. You seemed just a little sad.
so...
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.
I memorised every line,
every curve.
I came across time for you, Sarah.
I love you.
I always have.
I shouldn't have said that.
Think fast.
Trade places.
Faster.
Drive faster.
Kyle.
Oh, my God.
You stay here.
Let's get outta here.
Get out.
Kyle. Come on. Get up.
Help me.
Come on.
Help me.
Get out. Get out.
Get out.
Come on.
Don't stop. Run.
Sarah.
Kyle.
We did it, Kyle.
We got him.
No
No.
Wait.
What are you doing?
Cover, so he can't track us.
Come on.
Come on.
No. Kyle.
-Come on.
-Leave me here.
Move it, Reese.
On your feet, soldier.
On your feet.
Move it.
Get back. Go back.
-Run, Sarah.  -No.
Run.
Run.
Come on, mother fucker.
No.
You're terminated, fucker.
Kyle.
-10th October 7-a part
Where was I?
What's difficult is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to.
But I guess I have a while before you're old enough to understand these tapes
They're more for me at this point just so that I can get it straight.
Fill her up.
Should I tell you about your father?
Boy, that's a tough one.
Will it effect your decision to send him here. knowing that he is your father?
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.
God, a person could go crazy thinking about this.
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.
Maybe it'll help if...
you know that in the few hours
that we had together,
we loved a lifetime's worth.
-What did he just say?
-He says you're very beautiful.
He is ashamed to ask you for five dollars for this picture.
But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.
Pretty good hustle, kid.
What did he just say?
He said there's a storm coming in.
I know.
end
The future has not been written.
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.
I wish I could believe that.
My name is John Connor.
They tried to murder me before I was born.
When I was 13, they tried again.
Machines from the future.
Terminators.
All my life, my mother told me the storm was coming.
-Judgment Day. -Connor!
The beginning of a war between man and machines.
Three billion lives would vanish in an instant.
And I would lead what was left of the human race to ultimate victory.
It hasn't happened.
No bombs fell.
Computers didn't take control.
We stopped Judgment Day.
I should feel safe...
...but I don't.
So I live off the grid.
No phone, no address.
No one and nothing can find me.
I've erased all connections to the past.
But as hard as I try...
...I can't erase my dreams...
...my nightmares.
I feel the weight of the future bearing down on me.
A future I don't want.
So I keep running...
...as fast as I can.
Anywhere.
Nowhere.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Do you want me to call 911 ?
I like this car.
What are you--?
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.
Slow down and pull over immediately.
Lady, have you any idea how fast you were going?
Let me see your license and registration.
I like your gun.
What?
This stupid thing's not working.
What's wrong with this thing?
I hate machines.
-Hello? -Kate, it's your father.
You're blowing me off again.
I'm so sorry. You know how much l wanted to see you this weekend.
-We're having computer problems-- -I know, you can't talk about it.
It's just...
...Scott was really looking forward to this.
Katie. I wish I had more time to get to know him. I really do.
That's okay. You're bound to run into him at the wedding.
Please. I'm still in a state of denial about that.
-You're not the only one. -Hey, kiddo.
You don't need me to pass judgment on this guy.
You've done the right thing your whole life.
You won't make a mistake. You never do.
I'm the luckiest father in the world, you know?
I've never had to be afraid for my daughter.
Listen, I hate this. I gotta run. Come see me. I promise I won't cancel.
We will.
-Bye, Dad, I love you. -Love you too.
-Okay, what have we got? -This new computer virus is tricky.
It's infected half the civilian lnternet as well as secondary military apps.
-Payroll, inventory. -Primary defense nets are still clean?
So far the firewalls are holding up.
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use our Al to scan the infrastructure.
Search and destroy for any hint of the virus.
I know, Tony, but that's like going after a fly with a bazooka.
Once the connection's made, it should only be a few minutes.
During which we put everything under the control of one computer system.
The most intelligent system ever conceived.
I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.
Yes, sir.
Thanks.
You're supposed to go around to the back.
Hey, I said you're supposed to go--
-Take off your clothes. -Patience, honey.
Bitch. Wait your turn.
-Your clothes. -Talk to the hand.
Now.
Welcome to Jim's Burgers. Can I take your order?
-Jose Barrera? -Yeah, that's me.
Growing concern over widespread outages in the global digital network...
...have prompted rumors of a new computer super-virus.
-Wall Street analysts are confident.... -Shit! My mom's home.
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer. Here. Take that.
Go, go, go.
Elizabeth and William Anderson?
I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs. ls there something wrong?
What's going on?
I have to go to the clinic. It's an emergency.
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Well, I'll be back before you get up.
Cool it, guys, it's just me.
We've got a sick cat coming in.
Great.
Junkies.
Please, don't do that.
I suppose it was you who ripped us off last week.
Put the phone down.
Sorry.
I just....
I needed some medicine.
There's an emergency clinic half a mile away.
Can't do that.
How much did you take?
-Enough. -Well...
...this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs.
Take a look.
Hey!
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!
Next time bring a clue, not a paintball gun.
-No, this isn't what you think. -Yeah, right.
I think Hercules has got pneumonia. He started coughing and won't stop.
-Betsy, I've got a problem in the back. -A problem? This is an emergency!
-It sounds like a hairball. -I know what a hairball sounds like.
-Where's Dr. Monroe? -It's 5:30 in the morning.
I'm sure he's home sleeping. He'll come in if he has to.
Just wait in here with Hercules and I'll be a few minutes, all right?
Mike Kripke's basement.
What? What does that mean?
You're John Connor.
I'm Kate Brewster.
We went to West Hills Junior High together.
-Jesus. -What happened to you, John?
Middle of eighth grade, you just disappeared.
And there was that thing about your foster parents.
Yeah, they were murdered.
l didn't do it.
What the hell?
Is somebody with you?
Katherine Brewster?
No.
John Connor was here. Where did he go?
Tell me. Where did he go?
Katherine Brewster?
What are you doing? Let me down!
Let me down! Let me down!
Where is John Connor?
lf I tell you, will you let me go?
Yes.
He's...
...in the kennel, in a cage.
You said that you'd let me go.
I lied.
Please, please, please. You have to let me go!
John Connor.
It is time.
You here to kill me?
No. You must live.
Why are you here?
-Where are we going? -Keep moving.
Get out of here.
Now!
-No pulse. -See if you can get him down.
I can't.
This guy weighs a ton.
-911. -Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.
-Where are you now? -I don't know where. I'm in my truck.
It's a Toyota Tundra.
It says "Emery Animal HospitaI" on the side. I'm locked inside the back.
Hello?
Hello?
Shit! Shit!
Get off.
Let me out!
What are you doing here?
You tell me. You got me into this.
-Stop the car. -I can't. Not yet.
-You bastard! Stop the car! -Shut up!
Son of a bitch.
Goddamn it.
Look what you did to my car.
This is my company car, asshole.
Get your ass out here.
Get your ass out of the car. Now!
What are you doing?
If you don't have insurance, I'm gonna rip your balls off.
-I don't want any problems, okay? -Shut up!
Help!
Who's talking back there? What's going on?
-Calm down. -Shut up!
-I'm being kidnapped! Call the police! -Well, I'll be goddamned.
-Call 911! -A cop when you need one.
Help, please! Please!
Let me out of here! Help!
Get back here, asshole!
That's the cops! You have to pull over!
Yeah, first chance I get.
Hold on!
Stop it!
I'll drive.
Get out.
Excuse me.
Move over.
No sign of brain trauma.
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.
Do you even remember me?
Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?
"Hasta la vista, baby." Ring any bells?
That was a different T-1 01 .
What, do you come off an assembly line or something?
Exactly.
Oh, man. I'm gonna have to teach you everything all over again.
Katherine Brewster, have you sustained injury?
Drop dead, you asshole!
I'm unable to comply.
Where are you taking me?
To a safe location.
All right, get off at the next exit. Let her out.
Negative. Katherine Brewster must be protected.
-I thought they were after me. -You could not be located.
So a T-X was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants.
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?
No, no. No, you shouldn't even exist.
I mean, we took out Cyberdyne over 10 years ago.
-We stopped Judgment Day. -You only postponed it.
Judgment Day is inevitable.
l require a cutting tool.
Here, take the wheel.
-What are you doing? -I am powered by hydrogen fuel cells.
My primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack.
T-X is designed for extreme combat, driven by a plasma reactor...
...and equipped with onboard weapons.
Its arsenal includes...
...nanotechnological transjectors.
-Meaning? -It can control other machines.
lts body chassis is heavily armored and hardened to withstand attack.
-You'll find a way to destroy her. -Unlikely.
I'm an obsolete design.
T-X is faster, more powerful and more intelligent.
It's a far more effective killing machine.
Oh, great.
That's great.
My presence in this timeline has been anticipated.
T-X is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms.
So she's an anti-Terminator Terminator?
You've gotta be shitting me.
No, I am not shitting you.
When ruptured, the fuel cells become unstable.
Relax.
-Let me out of here! -Relax!
Man, this is wack.
It's been like this for hours. Every goddamn station.
Hey.
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?
Talk to the hand.
Help! Help me!
Help!
I think we better go.
Jerky?
You're kidnapping me.
-Look-- -God, you were always a delinquent.
And look at you now, sitting there like the bad boy thing still works.
What are you, some kind of gang member?
How do you live with yourself?
What?
Tell her who I am.
John Connor is leader of the Worldwide Resistance...
...and last hope of humankind.
Right. And him?
He's a robot from the future.
Living tissue over a metal skeleton, sent back in time to protect me.
Go to hell.
He doesn't mean you any harm.
I have a fiance.
He's gonna be looking for me.
What is it that you want?
Just...
...imagine...
...if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life.
Something amazing.
Maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done.
But there's a catch.
Something terrible has to happen.
You couldn't...
...live with yourself if you didn't try to stop it, but....
What are you talking about?
It's just-- The life you know...
...all the stuff that you take for granted...
...it's not gonna last.
Mike Kripke.
Back there, why did you say "Kripke's basement"?
Because Mike Kripke's house...
...that's where the kids used to go make out, right?
So you and me-- Wait, did we...?
Holy shit, we did.
We made out in Kripke's basement. I cannot believe you remembered that.
I must have made some kind of impression.
Give me a break.
I only remembered because the next day you were in the news.
Wait a second. You and me hooked up the day before I first met him.
And now again, 10 years later.
We were supposed to meet.
Coincidence.
Yeah.
Hon? Did you just get in?
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D. This is Detective Bell.
We're looking for Katherine Brewster. ls she here?
No.
-You're her fiance, Scott Mason? -Yes.
There was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works.
We're concerned something may have happened to her.
Where is she?
We got a report from a gas station attendant near Victorville...
...about a possible kidnapping and it might be related.
I'll help you find her.
Come with me.
Go.
Your mother?
I never even knew where she was buried.
I hit the road the day she died.
Why did you bring me here?
No! What are you doing?
Hey, stop!
Get away from it! Stop!
Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.
Her friends scattered her ashes in the sea.
They stored these weapons in accordance with her will.
What happened to her?
Leukemia.
I'm sorry.
We were living in Baja when she was diagnosed.
They only gave her six months.
But she fought for three years.
Long enough to make sure.
To make sure?
That the world didn't end.
"Every day after this one is a gift."
She told me, "We made it. We're free."
But I never really believed that.
I guess she didn't either.
You know you were about the closest thing to a father I ever had?
How pathetic is that?
Out of my way!
My mission is to protect you.
That's enough.
Move or I'll do it! I swear I will! I'll shoot you!
Go ahead. See what happens.
Don't do that.
Oh, my God.
This is the police. We have the building surrounded.
Release your hostage!
Just leave me here. I'm not the one you want. You're wasting your time.
Incorrect. John Connor leads the Resistance to victory.
How?
Why? Why me?
You are John Connor.
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle.
Look at me. I'm no leader, I never was!
I'm never gonna--
Let go.
You're right. You're not the one I want.
I'm wasting my time.
Fuck you, you fucking machine!
Better.
Oh, you were just dicking with me?
Anger is more useful than despair.
What?
Basic psychology is among my subroutines.
Perps still holed up?
Gotcha.
Good news. Your fiancee's okay.
Where is she?
Greenlawn Cemetery, up off the 5 freeway.
It's right by the desert. But they're gonna bring her back to the--
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.
Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.
I'm a post-trauma counselor for the sheriff's department.
How are you feeling?
He's not human.
He's really not human.
I know what it's like to be in a hostage situation.
I've been there myself.
The fear, the adrenaline.
You find yourself imagining things.
Impossible things.
Crazy things.
Insane things.
Take years to get over it.
-Go, go, go! -Move it!
Drop your weapon!
And the coffin!
Take him down! Take him down!
Resume fire!
We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.
Why? What makes her so goddamn important?
Through her, you contact remnants of the military...
...and learn how to fight Skynet, forming the core of the Resistance.
Later, your children will become important.
-What? -She's your wife.
Get in!
Do you want to live? Come on!
-It was Scott! How could it be Scott? -Your fiance?
The T-X is polymimetic, able to take the form of anything it touches.
Your fiance is dead.
Oh, my God!
Do something!
Get down.
We need a new vehicle.
Hey, come on.
We gotta keep moving.
She killed Scott because of me.
Look, I know this won't heIp...
...but sometimes things happen that we just can't change.
It's not your fault.
Are you sure about this?
About her and me, I mean.
Your confusion is not rational. She's a healthy female of breeding age.
There's more to it than that.
My database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding.
So this Terminatrix, how many others does she have on her hit list?
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth. Anderson, William.
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.
My father?
Having failed to acquire its primary target...
...T-X will resume its defauIt program.
-She's gonna kill my father too? -There's a high probability.
-No. -Who is he? What does he do?
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design, secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.
General Robert Brewster is program director of CRS...
...Cyber Research Systems, autonomous weapons division.
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.
Skynet is one of the digital defense systems developed under Brewster.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. Of course.
It all makes sense now.
If you hadn't come back when I was a kid, changed everything...
...we wouId have gotten together then. I wouId have met her father.
-Don't you see? -I don't understand.
Your father. This is all about your father.
He's the key. He always was.
Your father is the one who can shut Skynet down.
He's the only one who ever couId.
We have to get to him before the T-X does.
Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission.
This is your mission, to save people!
My mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.
I am giving you an order.
I am not programmed to follow your orders.
-After the nuclear war, you both-- -Nuclear war?!
There doesn't have to be a war! We can stop it!
There is insufficient time.
The first Iaunch sequences will be initiated at 6:1 8 p.m.
-What, today? -Affirmative.
John, what is he saying?
Judgment Day.
The end of the worId.
It's today, three hours from now.
Two hours and 53 minutes.
We must continue south into Mexico to escape the primary bIast zones.
No, we have to get to her dad.
The Mojave area will sustain significant nuclear fallout.
You will not survive.
You mean we go hide somewhere in a hole while the bombs fall?
It is your destiny.
-Fuck my destiny. -John.
You cannot seIf-terminate.
No, you can't. I can do whatever I want.
I'm a human being. I'm not some goddamn robot.
-Cybernetic organism. -Whatever!
Either we get her father to shut Skynet down...
...stop this shit from ever happening, or so much for the great John Connor.
Because your future, my destiny, I don't want any part of it. I never did.
Based on your pupil dilation, skin temperature and motor functions...
Please do what he says. You have to save my father!
We can reach CRS in approximately one hour...
...depending on traffic conditions.
I can't get a line.
The whole cell network is down.
Skynet is assuming controI over global communications...
...in preparation for its attack.
So if this war is between people and machines...
...why are you on our side?
The Resistance captured me and reprogrammed my CPU.
I was originally designed for assassination missions.
So...
...you don't really care if this mission succeeds or not.
If we get killed, does that mean anything to you?
If you were to die, I will become useless.
There will be no reason for me to exist.
Thank you for doing this.
Your gratitude is not required.
I am programmed to follow your commands.
Her commands?
Katherine Brewster had me reactivated...
...and sent through the time dispIacement fieId.
What exactly am I in this future of yours?
You're John Connor's spouse and second-in-command.
No, I--
What?
You're a mess.
Hey, you're not exactly my type, either.
Why didn't I send you back?
I am not authorized to answer your question.
-Why didn't he send you back? -He was dead.
Well, that sucks.
-Humans inevitably die. -Yeah, I know.
So how does it--? No.
Maybe I don't want to know.
How does he die?
John Connor was terminated on July 4th, 2032.
I was selected for the emotional attachment he had for my modeI...
...due to his boyhood experiences. This aided in my infiltration.
What are you saying?
I killed you.
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100, all military systems were secure.
They were. Only the civilian sector was affected. Internet, air traffic.
Minutes ago, guidance computers at Vandenberg crashed.
We thought it was an error. It looks like the virus.
-Early warning in AIaska is down. -Satellite signals are scrambled.
What about the missile silos, the subs?
We've lost contact.
You're saying this country is completely open to attack.
Theoretically, we couId be under attack already.
Who's doing this? A foreign power or some computer hacker in his garage?
We can't trace the virus or pin it down.
It keeps growing and changing, like it has a mind of its own.
This can't be happening.
The Pentagon's on the secure line. It's the chairman.
All right.
Look...
...none of this is gonna happen.
We get to your dad, get him to pull the pIug on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.
He won't have to kill me someday.
He'll never even exist.
You and I, we can just go our separate ways.
You know, Mike Kripke's basement....
That was the first time I ever kissed a guy.
Really?
Your levity is good.
It relieves tension and the fear of death.
We're hoping you have a solution for us.
I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready for a system-wide connection.
That's not what your civilian counterparts there told me.
They say we can stop this damn virus.
I understand there's a certain amount of performance anxiety...
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet into all of our systems...
...it'll squash this thing and give me back control of my military.
Mr. Chairman, I need to make myseIf very clear.
If we uplink now, Skynet will be in controI of your military.
But you'll be in control of Skynet, right?
That is correct, sir.
Then do it.
And Brewster, if this thing works...
...you'll get all the funding you'll ever need.
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Shall I?
No.
It's my job now.
-Skynet Defense System activated. -We're in.
We're past the firewalls, local defense nets, Minutemen, subs.
Skynet's fully operational, processing at 60 teraflops a second.
It shouId take less than a minute to find the virus and kill it.
Let's pray to God this works.
Power failure?
No. I don't know what it is.
What the hell is going on?
Daddy!
What are you doing here?
Daddy! Get away from it!
Watch out!
Daddy, don't move.
She'll be back.
We have to shut down Skynet.
Where's the system core? In this building?
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.
Skynet is the virus! It's why everything's falling apart!
Skynet has become seIf-aware.
In one hour it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.
What enemy?
Us!
Humans.
Oh, God! It's the machines. They're starting to take over.
My office, on this floor, we have to get there.
The access codes are in my safe.
-Why are they killing everyone? -To destroy any threat to Skynet.
Which ones are the codes?
Red envelope.
Crystal Peak. You have to get to Crystal Peak.
-What is he saying? -Crystal Peak.
A hardened facility in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Fifty-two miles northeast, bearing 0.5 degrees.
That's the system core?
It's your only chance.
You'll need a pIane. The particle accelerator leads to the runway.
Take care of my daughter.
Oh, Katie, I am sorry.
I opened Pandora's box.
Get down!
There's nothing you can do. Come on.
We must go. It is not safe here.
Kate, we have to go.
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.
He wanted us to shut Skynet down. Come on.
Come on.
Run!
Let's go.
That's it. We can follow it out to the runway.
Come on.
What?
Nothing.
You remind me of my mother.
Oh, God. She's coming.
What are you doing?
Powering up.
Come on.
It's working.
Just die, you bitch!
Come on.
There's my father's pIane. I trained on it.
Yes! He made it.
Get away from me.
Leave!
Now!
Let's go!
-The master's on. Throttle's set. -Come on. Let's go.
Oh, please. You can't do this.
I have no choice.
The T-X...
...has corrupted my system.
You can't kill a human being. You said so yourseIf.
Let him go!
You're fighting it right now.
My CPU is intact.
But I cannot controI my other functions.
You don't have to do this. You don't want to do this!
Desire is irrelevant.
I am a machine.
What is your mission?
To ensure the survival of John Connor...
...and Katherine Brewster.
You are about to fail that mission!
I can-- I cannot.
You know what you have to do.
You know my destiny.
I have to live.
-Are you okay? -What happened?
He couIdn't do it. He shut himseIf down.
-Can you fly? -Yeah.
Okay. 01 5 degrees...
...52 miles, our max air speed is about 160.
We've got 32 minutes.
It's just you and me now.
What if we can't stop it?
There's enough C-4 here to take out 10 supercomputers.
We're gonna make it, Kate.
The future is up to us.
That's gotta be it.
Skynet. There may be more of them.
Come on.
I think this is some kind of bIast door.
There's no way we can blow through this thing.
John, look.
Now what?
It's a code prompt.
Type in ''Dakota 775.''
''Red 176.''
Come on! We gotta get this thing open.
Here. It's ''Avalon 41 2.''
Put it in!
Come on!
I'm back.
Go! Now!
Come on!
-Thank you. -We'll meet again.
Go!
Come on!
You are terminated.
The elevator.
I'll set the detonator for five minutes.
That shouId give us enough time to get back up.
What is this pIace?
These computers are 30 years oId.
This isn't Skynet.
There's nothing here.
This is a fallout sheIter for VIPs.
Only they never got the warning.
Goddamn it!
There's nothing here!
Why didn't he tell us?
Why did he lead us down here?
To live.
That was his mission.
There was never any stopping it.
John...
...we couId just...
...let it go.
Hello?
Hello? Can somebody hear me?
This is Montana Civil Defense.
Somebody please come in.
Is there anybody there?
Anyone reading me? Over.
Rumors about a launch sequence.
Command and control have broken down.
Is anyone receiving me? Somebody?
Somebody please come in.
Anybody out there?
-SAC Nellis. We're under attack. -CQ? CQ?
Is anybody there?
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.
Connor? What the hell is happening? Who's in charge there?
I am.
Connor, can you help us?
This is Montana Civil Defense. Where did you say you were again?
By the time Skynet became self-aware...
...it had spread into millions of computer servers across the planet.
Ordinary computers in office buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere.
It was software and cyberspace.
There was no system core. It could not be shut down.
The attack began at 6:18 p.m., just as he said it would.
Judgment Day.
The day the human race was nearly destroyed...
...by weapons they'd built to protect themselves.
I should have realized our destiny was never to stop Judgment Day.
It was merely to survive it...
...together.
The Terminator knew.
He tried to tell us...
...but I didn't want to hear it.
Maybe the future has been written. I don't know.
All I know is what the Terminator taught me:
Never stop fighting.
And I never will.
The battle has just begun.
Many strange legends are told Of these jungles of India...
but none so strange as the story of a small boy named Mowgli.
It all began when the silence Of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound.
It was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungle.
It was a man cub!
Had I known how deeply I was to be involved...
I would've obeyed my first impulse and walked away.
This man cub would have to have nourishment, and soon.
It was many days travel to the nearest man village...
and without a mother's care, he would soon perish.
Then it occurred to me.
A family of wolves I knew had been blessed with a litter of cubs.
Oh, I knew there'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal instinct, but...
I wasn't so sure about Rama, the father.
Ten times the rains had come and gone.
And I often stopped by to see how Mowgli the man cub was getting along.
He was a favorite of all the young wolf cubs of the pack.
No man cub was ever happier.
And yet, I knew that someday...
he would have to go back to his own kind.
Then one night, the wolf pack elders met at council rock...
because Shere Khan the tiger...
had returned to their part of the jungle.
This meeting was to change the man cub's entire future.
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him.
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done?
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father.
Rama. Uh, come over here, please.
- Yes, Akela? - The council has reached its decision.
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack.
- He must leave at once. - Leave?
I'm sorry, Rama. There is no other way.
But... But the man cub is... Well, he's like my own son.
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack.
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger.
But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle.
Akela. Perhaps I can be of help.
You, Bagheera? How?
I know of a man village where he'll be safe.
Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together, so I'm sure he'll go with me.
So be it. Now there's no time to lose. Good luck.
Bagheera.
I'm getting a little sleepy. Shouldn't we start back home?
Mowgli, this time we're not going back.
- I'm taking you to a man village. - But why?
Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle.
And he has sworn to kill you.
Kill me? But why would he wanna do that?
He hates man.
And Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man...
just another hunter with a gun.
Aw, we'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that.
Nonsense. No one explains anything to Shere Khan.
Well, maybe so. But I'm not afraid.
- And besides, I... - Now that's enough.
We'll spend the night here. Things will look better in the morning.
Man cub? Man cub!
Now come on, up this tree. Be safer up there.
I don't wanna go back to the man village.
Go on. Up you go.
- That limb way up there? - That's right.
Is that all the better you can climb?
I... Oh... It's too big around.
And besides, I don't have any claws.
Now, get some sleep.
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow.
I... I wanna stay in the jungle.
Huh? You wouldn't last one day.
I'm not afraid. I-I can look out for myself.
Say now, what have we here?
It's a man cub.
A delicious man cub.
Oh, go away and leave me alone.
Oh, that's just what I should do, but I'm not.
Now, now, please go to sleep, man cub.
Yes, man cub. Please go to sleep.
Please go to sleep
Sleep, little man cub
Rest in peace
Sleep. Sleep.
Ba... Ba-Bagh-gheera.
Oh, now... Now look, there's no use arguing any more.
Oh! Now no more talk till morning.
He won't be here in the morning.
Hmm? Oh, yes, he will. I... Kaa!
Hold it, Kaa!
Oh! My sinus.
You have just made a serious mistake, my friend.
A very stupid...
- Now, now, now, now, Kaa, I was... - mistake.
Look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you.
- Oh, please, Kaa. - Both eyes, if you please.
You have just sealed your doom.
Look, Bagheera! Look, Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.
Just you wait till I get you in my coils.
Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!
"He's got a knot in his tail."
Ooh, this is going to slow down my slither.
So, you can look out For yourself, can you?
So you want to stay in the jungle, do you?
Yes. I wanna stay in the jungle.
Oh! Now, now, now for the last time, go to sleep!
Man cub.
Man cub.
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up Two, three, four
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up Two, three, four
Hup, two, three, four
A parade.
Oh, no! The dawn patrol again.
Company, sound off!
Oh, the aim of our patrol Is a question rather droll
For to march and drill Over field and hill
Is a military goal
Is a military goal
With a hup Two, three, four
Dress it up two, three, four
By the ranks or single file
Over every jungle mile
Oh, west amp and crush through the underbrush
In the military style
In the military style
Hello. What are you doing?
Shh! Drilling.
- Can I do it too? - Sure. Just do what I do.
But don't talk in ranks. It's against regulations.
To the rear! March!
The other way. Turn around.
Hup, two, three, four
Keep it up Two, three, four
To the rear! Ho!
Company, halt!
That means stop.
Company, left face!
March, march, march. My feet are killing me.
I'm puttin' in for a transfer to another herd.
Silence in the ranks!
Dress up that line.
Pull it in, Winifred.
Inspection! Arms!
Stick your nose out.
- Like this? - That's right.
A dusty muzzle.
Soldier, remember, in battle, that trunk can save your life.
- Take good care of it, my man. - Yes, sir!
Very good. Cary on.
- Let's have a little more spit and polish on those bayonets. - Yes, sir.
Esprit de corps.
That's the way I earned my commission in the Maharajah's fifth pachyderm brigade.
Back in '88, it was. Uh, or was it?
Here it comes. The Victoria Cross bit again.
It was then I received the Victoria Cross...
for bravely above and beyond the call of duty.
Those were the days.
Discipline. Discipline was the thing.
Builds character, and all that sort of thing, you know.
Oh, oh, where was I? Oh, yes. Inspection.
Well, very good.
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier. This is the army.
Eyes front.
Lieutenant, that haircut is not regulation.
Rather on the gaudy side, don't you think?
There. That's better.
And as for you...
Oh, there you are.
Let's keep those heels together, shall we, son?
Okay, Pop. Sir.
Yes, now that's better.
Well, a new recruit, eh?
I say, what happened to your trunk?
Hey! Stop that!
A man cub! Oh, this is treason!
Sabotage! I'll have no man cub in my jungle!
- I-It's not your jungle! - Hold it! Hold it! I can explain, Hathi.
Colonel Hathi, If you please, sir.
Oh, yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.
Uh, the man cub is with me. I'm taking him back to the man village.
- To stay? - You have the word of Bagheera.
Good. And remember, an elephant never forgets.
I don't know what the army's coming to these days.
These young whippersnappers, who do they think they are?
Let's get on with it! Right face!
Forward march!
Dear, haven't you forgotten something?
Nonsense, Winifred old girl. An elephant never forgets.
Well, you just forgot our son.
Uh, uh, son... Son?
Son! Oh, yes, yeah, yeah! Quite right.
To the rear! March!
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a Colonel, just like my...
- If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times... - Oh!
Pop! Look out!
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say "halt."
He said an elephant never forgets.
It's not funny.
Now let's get out of here quick before anything else happens.
Bagheera! Where are we goin'?
You're going back to the man village right now.
- I'm not going. - Oh, yes, you are!
I'm staying right here!
You're going if I have to drag you every step of the way.
- Let go, you... - You let go of me!
Oh, that does it.
I've had it, man cub!
From now on, you're on your own alone!
Don't worry about me.
Foolish man cub.
Doo-bee doo-bee doo-bee-dee-doo
Well, it's a doo-bah-dee-doo Yes, it�s a doo-bah-dee-doo
I mean a doo-bee doo-bee, doo-bee doo-bee, doo-bee-dee-doo
And with...
Well, now.
What have we here?
Hey, what a funny little bit of a...
- Oh! - Go away!
Oh, boy, I've seen everything in these woods.
Hoo! What have I run on? What a pretty thing this is.
- Leave me alone. - Well, now.
That's pretty big talk, little britches.
I'm big enough.
Pitiful. Hey, kid, you need help.
And old Baloo's gonna learn you to fight like a bear.
Now come on, I'm gonna show you.
Yeah!
All right, now, kid, loosen up. Get real loose and then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now move! That's it!
Now give me a big bear growl. Scare me.
Oh, boy.
I'm talkin' about like a big bear.
He's in trouble! Why, I-I shouldn't have left him alone.
- A big one. Right from your toes. - How's that?
- Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid. - Oh, no! It's Baloo.
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.
Weave about now and look for an opening.
Keep movin'. Keep...
Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid. Come on, that's it.
He's a dandy.
Fine teacher you are, old iron paws.
- Oh, thanks, Bagheera. - Eh, tell me, tell me, uh...
after you knock your pupil senseless, uh, how do you expect him to remember the lesson? Hmm?
Well, I... I, uh... Well, I didn't mean to lay it on him so hard.
I'm not hurt. I'm all right.
I'm a lot tougher than some people think.
You better believe it.
Now let's go once more. Now I want you to keep circlin' or I'm gonna knock your roof in again.
You better keep movin'.
Hey! Right on the button.
No, no-no, no-no. Now you're ticklin'.
No! No. N-N-Now, now we don't do that here in the jungle.
No, you're ticklin'. I-I can't stand that ticklin'.
- Help, Bagheera! - Oh, boy, that's all he needs. More confidence.
- Give up, Baloo? - I give up, I told ya.
Ooh! I give... Hey!
You know somethin'? You're all right, kid. What do they call you?
Mowgli. And he's going back to the man village right now.
Man village? They'll ruin him. They'll make a man out of him.
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.
Certainly you do.
Oh? And just how do you think he will survive?
"How do you think he will..." What do you mean, "How do you think he..."
He's with me, ain't he? And I'll learn him all I know.
Well, that shouldn't take too long.
Look, now it's like this, little britches.
All you've gotta do is...
Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries And your strife
I mean the bare necessities are Mother Nature's recipes
That bring the bare necessities of life
Wherever I wander Wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder Of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree to make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few
You eat ants?
You better believe it. And you're gonna love the way they tickle.
Mowgli, look out!
- The bare necessities of life will come to you - But when?
They'll come to you
Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries And your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities Of life
Now when you pick a paw paw
- Or a prickly pear - Ow!
And you prick a raw paw Well, next time, beware
Don't pick the prickly pear By the paw
When you pick a pear Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw When you pick a pear of the big paw paw
They say Japan was made by a sword
They say the old gods dipped a coral blade into the ocean
and when they pulled it out
four perfect drops fell back into the sea
and those drops became the islands of Japan
I say Japan was made by a handful of brave men
Warriors willing to give their lives
for what seems to have become a forgotten word...
Honor
Ladies and Gentlemen... Winchester
an American leader in all forms of armament used by the United States Army
celebrates our nation's centenial
by bringing you a true American hero.
One of our most decorated warriors this country has ever known...
winner of the medal of honor for his gallantry on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg
He's late of the seventh cavalry and their triumph campaign...
against the most savage of the Indian nations.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...
Captain Nathan Algren.
Captain Nathan Algren!
Yes!
Yes!
Please, one moment, thank you.
God damn you, Algren! Get out of there!
This is your last performance, you are fired.
Now get out of there!
Come on!
I'm sick of this, come on!
Yes!
My thanks, Mr. McCabe. You are too kind.
This, ladies and gents, is the gun that's winning the west.
Why, many's the time, I've found myself...
surrounded by a swarm of...
...angry hostiles.
with nothing but this rifle, between me and a certain and gruesome death.
But let me tell you folks...
the red man is a fearsome enemy.
If He'd had his way, this scalp of mine would be long gone...
and there'd be a balder man standing before you today.
Like those poor bastards out there on the Little BigHorn.
Bodies stripped bare
mutilated
left to rot in the sun.
This, ladies and gentlemen, the 73 lever-action...
...Trapper
It's got a 7-shot capacity, accurate at 400 yards, one round per second...
Son, have you ever seen what this could do to a man?
This would blow a hole in your daddy 6 inches wide.
That's right, Missy.
This beauty, you could kill yourself five, six, seven braves...
without ever having to reload. Note the patented loading port...
and the smooth cocking action.
My thanks, on behalf of those who died
in the name of better mechanical amusements...
and commercial opportunities.
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders
God bless you all.
I must say, Captain, you have a flair for the old melodrama.
You are alive. I am, indeed.
You man Custer says to me, "we're going to the Little BigHorn
says I, "What's this 'we' stuff?" It's the walking ticket for me."
Nine lives I have. But I'll tell you what else I have.
I have a good job for the both of us.
God knows it looks as if you'll need one real soon.
What kind of a job?
The only job you are fit for, boyo. A man's job!
Unless of course you got your heart set on a career in the theater.
Nathan!
Just listen to what your man has to say.
Been a while, it's good to see you.
Nathan Algren, I would like you to meet Mr. Omura, from Japan.
and his associate, whose name I've given up try to pronounce.
Sit down, please.
Whiskey.
Now Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized country.
And Mr. Omura here is...
...willing to spend what it takes to hire white experts to train their army.
And if we play our cards right, the Emperor grants the U. S...
exclusive rights to supply arms.
Well, I have an agreement with the Winchester company,
and I am certain that Mr. Omura here has some concept of what an agreement is.
Your performances for the Winchester company bring you $25 a week.
We will pay you $400 a month.
$5 for each.
and another $500 when we get the job done.
How many other genuine war heroes you got lined up?
He's rude
That's how it is here. A land of cheap traders.
Whiskey.
So, who will we be training your boys to fight?
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.
He is a samurai.
Samurai?
The word you might use is "warrior"
Mr. Omura is familiar...
with our experiences dealing with renegade.
Is he?
He's even read your book.
Captain Algren's study of the tribes...
was a crucial factor in our defeat of the Cheyenne.
Please excuse
What is funny?
The corps back together again is so...
...inspiring
Excuse me
Excuse me. I need to use the necessities.
This isn't a problem
I'll just talk to him for a minute.
Colonel Bagley.
We contacted you because you are Captain Algren's superior officer...
and you assured us of his participation.
He'll do it.
I just need a minute.
Nathan.
I did what I was ordered to do out there.
And I have no remorse.
So, what do you say we put the past behind us?
You want me to kill Jappos? I will kill Jappos.
I am not asking you to kill anybody, but the enemy...
You want me to kill the enemies of Jappos.
I will kill the enemies of Jappos.
Reb, or Sioux, or Cheyenne...
For 500 bucks a month, I will kill whoever you want.
But keep one thing in mind...
I'd happily kill you for free.
June 12th, 1876.
There is some comfort in the emptiness of the sea.
No past, no future.
And then at once, I am confronted by the hard truth of the present circumstances.
I have been hired to help supress the rebellion of yet another tribal leader.
Apparently, this is the only job for which I am suited.
I am beset by the ironies of my life.
Yokohama Harbor, 1876
Captain Algren, I presume?
Yes
Jolly good. How do you do? Simon Graham.
20 years ago, this was a sleepy little town.
Now, look at it.
You see, the Emperor is mad for all things western.
and the Samurai believe it's changing too fast.
The ancient and the modern are at war for the soul of Japan
So your new employer, Mr. Omura...
is bringing in every western expert he can get his hands on.
Lawyers from France, engineers from Germany...
architects from Holland and now of course, warriors from America.
I came over with the British trade mission, oh, years ago...
I was soon relieved of my position where I had a long long unfortunate tendency to tell the truth...
in a country where no one ever says what they mean.
So now, I very accurately translate other people's lies.
For 2000 years, no Emperor was even seen by a commoner.
You have to realise what a treat this is, what an honor.
This is all highly ritualised, of course.
You may look at him, but do not speak.
Unless you are spoken to, obviously.
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.
Do I look presentable? I haven't worn this in a decade
Rather snug around the midriff
and bow
The divine Emperor Meiji bids you welcome.
He's grateful for the assistance your country offers.
We hope to accomplish the same national harmony you enjoy in your homeland.
The Emperor is most interested in your American indians.
If you have fought against them in battle?
We have, Your Highness. The red man is a brutal adversary.
The Emperor wishes to ask Captain Algren if it is truth that...
they wear eagle feathers and paint their faces before going into battle.
and that they have no fear.
They are very brave.
Bow
Thank you very much.
And step back
step back... step back and turn.
Right, you little bastards, you will stand up straight in a line...
or I will personally shit-kick every Far Eastern buttock that appears before my eyes.
Well done, Sergeant.
When you understand the language, everything falls into place.
The first rank will kneel, rifles at the ready.
The second rank...
July 22nd, 1876. For six months' work, I'm to receive...
...3 years of Captain's pay, teaching Orientals to soldier.
They are an army of conscripts...
most of them are peasants, who have never seen a gun.
Fire! Ute!
They are led by General Hasegawa...
a man of small stature, who nonetheless commands enormous respect.
What can General tell me about this man, this samurai...
Katsumoto.
He seems to have great knowledge of Katsumoto and his rebellion.
I'll count on his help when facing this samurai.
Who supplys their weapons?
Katsumoto no longer dishonours himself by using firearms, you see.
He uses no firearms?
To those who honor the old ways, Katsumoto is a hero.
How well does he know this man?
Well, the General and Katsumoto fought together for the Emperor.
He fought with the samurai?
He is Samurai.
You must understand Katsumoto pledged his sword to defend the Emperor.
They say a Samurai's sword is his soul.
They are paradoxical people, samurai.
I've tried to write a book about them for years...
but they keep to themselves.
The bastards are still wearing armor.
Yes, when the Irish were still comporting themselves in loincloths
These chaps were already the most sophisticated warriors on earth.
I need more detailed information on their battle tactics.
I have several more books just waiting to be translated.
Our captain will be speaking the lingo in no time.
You should hear him blather on in Blackfoot.
Really? A fellow linguist? Oh, Capital!
Oh come on Sir, a word or two in the savage tongue.
Just "hello" or "Goodbye".
No, No..."Cut his tongue out and boil him in oil".
Early day tomorrow, Captaindarlin' so it is bed time, isn't it?
I always had a dread fascination with scalping. I never quite understood its technique.
Imagine someone who hates you with the utmost intensity.
Grabbing a handful of your hair while you are lying prostrate and helpless.
And scraping a dull blade of a rusty knife around your scalp...
with a saw-like motion.
and let your imagination grasp
if you can, Mr. Graham, the effect of a strong, quick jerk on the turf of your hair.
to release any clinging particles, of course would have, on your nervous system.
You will have some idea of how it feels to be scalped.
Mr. Graham.
How soon can you translate those books?
Right away.
Just delighted to do it, you're taking such interest in Samurai.
I don't give a damn about the Samurai. I want to know my enemy.
I shall not sleep until it is done.
Ah... foggy
I bid you good night.
Can I get you anything, sir?
This is a punitive expedition, Captain.
Colonel Bagley, these people had nothing to do with the raids.
Good night, Sir.
Quietly now, boys.
Fire!
I suppose we should be grateful they are all firing in the same direction.
could not put it better myself, Sir.
Rifle butt against the shoulder.
Eye down the sight, now slowly...
Ute! [Japanese] (Fire!)
Well done. You've got that done.
Nathan...
Katsumoto has attacked a railroad at the border of his province.
we cannot govern a country in which we cannot travel freely.
He must be stopped now.
My railroad is a priority for this country.
They are not ready.
The rebels don't have a single rifle.
They're savages with bows and arrows.
whose sole occupation for the last 1,000 years has been war.
You have superior fire power and a larger force.
I am ordering your regiment to move against the rebel Katsumoto.
You will track him down and engage him.
Load
Mr. Graham...
tell this man to fire at me.
I beg your pardon?
Tell this man if he does not shoot me...
I will kill him.
Captain, if I might have a word...
Tell him.
Tell him
Time to get it up.
Shoot him!
Load.
Shoot him!
Load
Faster!
Faster!
Shoot me, damn it!
Fire!
Fire!
Ute! Ute! [Japanese] (Fire!)
They are not ready.
The regiment leaves at 6:00 A.M.
1,000 miles of rail track laid in less than 2 years.
It's astonishing.
and Omura owns all of it?
As soon as he get rid of the Samurai, he will, yes.
How do you intend to find Katsumoto?
Don't worry, Mr. Graham. I assure you...
he will find us.
Move into position!
Yoshino Province, 1876.
First Company, form a battle line on me!
Pay attention, it will save your life!
Second Company, form on first Company.
Third and Fourth Company form up behind.
Fill it on command!
Where is Hasegawa? Unclear, he refused to fight against Katsumoto.
Cover down! Captain Algren...
we are not here as combatants.
Then who's gonna lead these men?
Their own officers, for Chris sake, let's move to the rear.
We'll be there presently
Fix bayonet.
Fix bayonet.
Chakken! (Fix bayonet!)
Mr. Graham, you'll accompany me to the rear, okay? Of course.
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear.
and see to the disposition of the supply trains.
Sergeant Gant, did you hear my order?
Aye, I did indeed, Sir.
Good, then you will obey it.
Now!
No disrespect intended, Sir, but shove it up your arse.
Load! Load!
Samurai come.
You will be fine, son.
Assume firing positions! Assume firing positions!
Fire on my order only!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Reload!
Hold the line!
Fire at will.
Translate it: Fall back!
Zeb!
He's mine.
Stop!
Take him away.
What is your name?
Insolent swine! Answer!
Leave him be.
This is my son's village.
We are deep in the mountains and the winter is coming.
You cannot escape.
Jolly good.
My Lord, why do you spare the barbarian?
He is ashamed in defeat.
He should kill himself.
This is not their custom.
Then...
...I will kill him.
Father...
I don't think...
Ujio...
...there will be plenty of killing to come.
For now...
...we will learn about our new enemy.
Keep him alive.
He's in bad shape.
Sake...
Sake?
Sake...
Sake...
Taka will take care of you.
Sake...
Sake...
Sake...
Let him drink, aunt.
No. That will not do.
This is my village.
This is my house.
Please... sake...
Sugay!
No!
No!
I told you!
Morning.
Over there.
Over there!
Go. You, go.
What's your name?
You have a name, don't you?
Name?
Namai?
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?
I know why you don't talk.
You're angry. You're angry because I make you wear a dress.
Son of a bitch.
This temple was built by my family 1,000 years ago.
My name is Katsumoto.
What is your name?
Are my words not correct?
I will practise my English with you...
if you would honor me...
You keep me alive just to speak English?
Then what do you want?
To know my enemy.
I've seen what you did to your enemies.
The warriors in your country do not kill?
They don't cut the heads off defeated, kneeling men.
General Hasegawa asked me to help him end his life.
A samurai cannot stand the shame of defeat.
I was honored to cut off his head.
Many of our customs seem strange to you...
and the same is true of yours.
For example...
Not to introduce yourself is considered extremely rude, even among enemies.
Nathan Algren.
I am honored to meet you.
I have enjoyed this conversation in English.
I have questions.
I have introduced myself, you have introduced yourself. This is a very good conversation.
I have questions!
Questions come later. Who was the warrior in the red armor?
My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.
and the woman who cares for me?
My sister, Hirotaro's wife. Her name is Taka.
I killed her husband?
It was a good death!
You! Come... please...
Thank you.
Douzo! [Japanese] (please!)
He smells like the pigs. Tell my brother I cannot stand this.
Why don't you tell him?
At least make him take a bath.
Nicely done!
They may be children, but they are strong.
You try.
Fight!
Muyamini [Japanese] (How absurd you are!)
Put down the sword.
Drop it!
I just realised...
I've been remiss. Forgive me. I...
have yet to thank you for looking out for me yesterday.
That is your job, correct?
Protecting me.
Well done, "Bob". You don't mind if I call you "Bob", do you?
I knew a Bob once.
God, he was ugly as a mule.
You a ladies' man, Bob?
Ujio is teaching you the way of Japanese sword.
Yes, indeed.
You fought against your Red Indians?
Yes.
Tell me of your part in this war.
Why? I wish to learn.
Read a book.
I'd rather have a good conversation.
Why? Because...
we are both students of war
So...
you were the General of your army?
No... I was a Captain.
This is a low rank?
a middle rank
Then who was the General?
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?
People in your country do not like conversation?
He was a Lieutenant-Colonel.
His name was Custer.
I know this name.
He killed many warriors.
Oh yes. Many warriors.
So he was a good General.
No, he wasn't a good General, he was arrogant, foolhardy.
and he got massacred because he took a single battallion...
...against 2,000 angry indians.
2,000 Indians? How many men for Custer?
Two hundred and eleven. I like this General Custer.
He was a murderer, who fell in love with his own legend.
and his troopers died for it.
I think this is a very good death.
Oh, maybe you can have one just like it someday.
If it is my destiny.
What you want from me?
What do you want for yourself?
What are you doing?
Why are we having these conversations?
What the hell am I doing here?
In spring, the snows will melt and passes will open.
Until that time, you are here.
Good day, Captain.
1876... day unknown, month unknown.
I continue to live among these unusual people.
I'm their captive, in that I cannot escape.
Mostly I'm treated with a kind of a mild neglect
as if I was a stray dog, or an unwelcome guest.
Everyone is polite, everyone smiles and bows.
But beneath this courtesy, I detect their deep breath of moral feeling.
Higen
They are an intriguing people.
From the moment they wake...
they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue.
I've never seen such discipline.
I'm surprised to learn that the word "Samurai" means...
..."to serve".
and that Katsumoto believes his rebellion to be in the service of the Emperor.
Please forgive, too many mind.
Too many mind?
Mind the sword, mind the people watch, mind the enemy.
Too many mind.
No mind.
No mind.
Thank you. More rice?
Taka. He spoke Japanese!
Eat a lot. Don't be polite.
Not so fast. What are these?
Hashi (Chopstick)
Hashi (Chopstick)
How can he understand?
Hana (Nose)
Top knot.
Mimi (Ear)
Chawan (Rice bowl)
No, no, not so fast.
I am Algren.
Algren.
all-gren.
Nobutada. Nobutada.
Magojiro. Magojiro.
Higen. Higen.
Taka.
Brother, please make him leave. I cannot stand it.
Is he so repulsive?
The shame is unbearable. I ask permission to end my life.
You will do as you are told!
You'd rather I kill him to avenge your husband?
Yes
Hirotaro tried to kill the American. It was karma.
Yes, I know
Forgive my weakness.
There must be some reason why he is here.
It is beyond my understanding.
She has been very kind to me.
She is honored to have my guest in her house.
Winter, 1877. What does it mean to be a Samurai?
To devote yourself utterly to a set of moral principles.
To seek a stillness of your mind.
And to master the way of the sword.
He is getting better, no?
But still so ugly.
Cold
Watashi samui (I feel cold)
Watashi nimo samui. (I feel cold too)
also... watashi
the fire.
Hi [Japanese] (fire)
Moeru (to burn)
Moeru... to burn. Moeru
No, please.
Japanese men do not help with this.
I am not Japanese.
I'm sorry
gomennasai (Excuse me)
Gomennasai for your husband... Hirotaro.
He did his duty.
You did your duty.
I accept your apology...
hahaue (mom)
What are you doing here?
We go inside.
Have you washed your hand?
Spring, 1877. This marks the longest I have stayed in one place...
...since I left the farm at 17.
There is so much here that I will never understand.
I have never been a church-going man.
And what I have seen on the field of battle has led me to question God's purpose.
But there is indeed something spiritual in this place.
and though it may forever be obscure to me.
I cannot but be aware of its power.
I do know it is here that I have known my first untroubled sleep in many years.
No, You gotta get the ball!
Go and get it!
Not me
You gotta get the ball!
the ball!
Ujio will win in three moves.
In five!
Next in five moves.
In six.
A draw!
Who is this amateur?
Katsumoto!
Protect Katsumoto! Protect our Lord!
Lord, please go inside!
The perfect blossom is a rare thing.
You could spend your life looking for one...
and it will not be a wasted life.
Who sent those men to kill you?
I am writing a poem about a dream I had.
the tigers' eyes are like my own.
But he comes from across a deep and troubled sea.
Was it the Emperor?
Omura?
If the Emperor wishes my death, he has but to ask.
So it was Omura.
I'm having trouble finishing the poem.
Can you suggest a last line?
I am not a writer.
Yet you have written many pages since you came here.
What else has she told you?
You have nightmares.
Every soldier has nightmares.
Only one who is ashamed of what he has done.
You have no idea what I have done.
Go away!
You have seen many things.
I have.
And you do not fear death, but sometimes you wish for it.
Is this not so?
Yes.
I, also.
It just happens to men who have seen what we have seen.
And then I come to this place of my ancestors.
I remember, like these blossoms, we are all dying.
To know life in every breath...
...every couple of tea, every life we take.
the way of the warrior
Life in every breath.
That is "Bushido".
Hai. (Yes)
The Emperor has granted a safe passage to Tokyo.
We leave tomorrow.
Good. Good.
when I took these, you were my enemy.
Excuse me.
No, so sorry. I am finishing.
I must go away.
Hai (Yes)
You have been kind to me.
I won't forget
Algren-san.
Algren-san
Go!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Algren?
Algren, my God, you are alive.
Will you never cease to astonish?
Howitzers
Yes, indeed. As soon as the Emperor signs the damn trade agreement.
He gets the whole package...
including this particular item.
200 rounds a minute.
and the new cartridge just cut down on jamming.
I need a bath.
After living with those savages, I can only imagine.
Welcome back, Captain.
You rise against me, my teacher.
No, Highness. I rise against your enemies.
They are my advisors, like you.
They advise in their own interest.
I need advisors who know the modern world.
If I am no use, I will happily end my life.
No...
I need your voice in the council.
It is your voice we need, Highness.
You are a living God. Do what you think is right.
I am a living God...
...as long as I do what they think is right.
What sad words you speak...
Forgive me for saying what a teacher must.
Have you forgotten your people?
Tell me what to do...
...my teacher.
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.
You must find the wisdom for all of us.
Ah, gentlemen, come in.
Captain Algren, it seems you have endured your captivity with little ill effect.
I was not ill-treated, Sir.
Mr. Omura, I have here a draft of the arms agreement.
Captain Algren, I'm eager to know how many Samurai have joined Katsumoto.
I'm afraid I don't know.
You spent the entire winter at his encampment.
As his prisoner.
Has he fortified his position? has he acquired firearms?
Come man, tell us what you saw.
As you said, colonel they are savages...
with bows and arrows.
Sir, about the... I'm sure your documents are in order, ambassador, thank you.
If you leave them on my desk, I'll address them at the appropriate time.
With all due respect, Sir.
our president's patience is wearing thin.
Perhaps there's someone else we should be speaking to.
With all due respect, ambassador.
Perhaps there's someone else we should be speaking to.
For instance, the French or the English,
or with any of the legations waiting in the next room.
Yes. well, we should be looking forward to hearing from you.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.
Perhaps you and I might have a word in private.
Please, sit down.
May I offer you a whiskey?
No, thank you.
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man, is he not?
He is a tribal leader.
I've known many of them.
But none who are Samurai. Their ways have great appeal.
I don't see how this concerns me.
Ah, but it does.
You see, you were right. Captain Algren.
Last year we were not prepared to go to battle.
You were right and Colonel Bagley was wrong.
But now we are ready.
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract the other Samurai to his cause,
we will have 10 years of rebellion.
This is something I will not allow.
Either I'll stop him at the council today.
or you will lead my army against him.
and with these new weapons, you will crush him.
I appreciate the offer.
It is not an offer.
Mr. Omura, my contract with you, was to train your army.
Then we will make a new contract.
One that will recognize the extraordinary contribution you have made to the Emperor.
Do we understand each other?
Yes, we understand each other perfectly well.
Then I am pleased.
Follow him. If he goes anywhere near Katsumoto, kill him.
Captain Algren, what in heaven's name is going on?
The diplomatic community's abuzz
Omura has passed laws against the Samurai.
Mr. Graham, I need a drink.
Is your friend, Katsumoto, really planning to go up against the council this afternoon?
You, Samurai! Don't you know about the order?
Oh my God, it's started.
Hey boy, are you listening?
No wonder the foreigners mock you.
Let's give this Samurai a haircut.
Cut off his top knot.
Get down! Kneel!
Captain Algren
Lower your weapons!
Lower your weapons!
Lower your weapons!
Lower your weapons!
Who are you?
I am Captain Algren.
Stop!
Get down!
Let's go.
I'll take you home.
Jolly good
We must resist the western powers...
...by becoming powerful ourselves.
Our army, our economy must be strong.
Minister, you honor us.
It is my honor to rejoin this council.
Perhaps you are unaware of the law against wearing sword.
I read every law carefully.
Yet you bring weapons into this chamber?
This chamber was protected by my sword when...
We need no protection. We are a nation of laws.
We are a nation of whores, selling ourselves...
If we are whores, the Samurai made us this way.
I have not seen the Omura family giving gold to the masses.
Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regreat...
but I must ask you to remove your sword.
This sword serves the Emperor...
only he can command me to remove it.
The Emperor's voice is too pure to be heard in this council.
Then, I must refuse to give up my sword.
Then regretfully, my guards will accompany you to your home in Tokyo.
There you will await our summons.
I heard you were leaving
Omura offers my job and you run away.
I suppose I should thank you.
$500 a month, including back pay for time spent... in captivity.
Enough there to climb back inside a bottle for the rest of your life.
You are welcome.
Well, it is pretty much over.
Katsumoto is under arrest, Omura won't let him last the night.
With Katsumoto dead, we shouldl have little trouble handling what's left of the rebellion.
Even without you.
Especially without you.
Just tell me one thing
What is it about your own people that you hate so much?
Save us the trouble...
The Samurai are finished!
Stop!
Don't come any closer!
Don't stop. Whatever you do, don't stop.
Minister Omura has commanded us to photograph the traitor.
Stop! Somebody!
Bring that equipment here NOW!
Immediately!
You stop!
You insolent, useless son of a peasant dog!
How dare you show your sword in his presence! Do you know who this is?
This is the President of the United States of America.
He is here to lead our armies in victorious battle against the rebels!
It's not my responsibility...
Now get over there and help those men with their equipment!
Carry the equipment.
President of the United States?
Sorry, I think I made you sick.
How is your poem coming?
The end is proving difficult.
This is Mr. Simon Graham. He would like very much to take your photograph.
This is an honor.
I thought you returned to America.
I decided to stay. See if I could convince you to escape.
How do you plan to do that?
Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care to take pictures of my village.
I would be greatly honored.
My Lord!
My Lord, no!
Nobutada!
Father, let me stay.
It is my time.
My lord...
...we must go.
The Emperor could not hear my words.
His army will come here.
It is the end.
For 900 years, my ancestors have protected our people.
Now...
I have failed them.
So you're taking your own life...
...in shame?
Shame for a life of "Service, Discipline, Compassion"
The way of the Samurai is not necessary any more.
Necessary?
What can be more necessary?
I will die by the sword.
my own or my enemy's
Then let it be your enemy's.
Together, we will make the Emperor hear you.
He was a good man.
Will you fight the white men, too?
If they come here, yes.
Why?
Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.
The way of Samurai is difficult for children, he misses his father.
And he is angry because I am the cause of that.
No. He is angry because he fears you will die as well.
My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.
That is what he believed.
I would be afraid to die in battle.
So would I
But you have been in many battles.
And I was always afraid.
I don't want you to go.
Algren
They are coming.
I take 2 full regiments. They will come in waves of a thousand.
They may have a howitzer. It makes no difference.
They will come and we will make our stand.
How many men will we have?
Maybe 500. Like General Custer, huh?
There was once a battle at a place called Thermopylae.
300 brave Greeks held off a Persian army of a million men.
I understand this number.
For two days, the Greeks made them pay so dearly...
...the Persian army lost all taste for battle.
And they were defeated soon after.
What do you have in mind?
Take away the advantage of their guns.
They're overconfident. we will use that.
Lure them close, close enough for a sword.
You believe a man can change his destiny?
I think a man does what he can...
until his destiny is revealed.
May 25th, 1877. This will be the last entry in this journal.
I've tried to give a true accounting of what I've seen, what I've done.
I do not presume to understand the course of my life.
I know I'm grateful to have partaken in all this.
Even if for a moment.
Algren-san, will you come with me?
If you wear this armor, it will honor us.
You will need this.
What does it say?
I belong to the warrior in whom the older ways have joined the new.
Good God!
Sir, The Imperial Army of Japan demands your surrender.
If you and your fellows lay down your arms, you will not be harmed.
This is not possible, as Mr. Omura knows
Captain Algren...
we will show you no quarter.
You rise against us. You are the same as they are.
I will look for you on the field.
Captain Algren Yes, Mr. Graham
Perhaps you can use this for your book.
Yes, I will.
Captain...
Godspeed. Mr. Graham.
Stand up straight!
Well, they won't surrender.
Are we ready?
Get into your position!
Chakken! (Fix bayonet!)
Commence firing!
Ute! [Japanese] (Fire!)
Ute!
Adjust the battery
Ready!
Ute!
Ute!
They are covering their retreat.
You see, even the mighty Samurai cannot stand up to the howitzers.
Signal the attack.
I advise sending in skirmishers first.
Nonsense! Full attack!
Step forward!
They are coming.
Wait for a volley.
Second volley.
Set fire
What on earth!
What is happening?
Shoot!
Their attack has been stopped.
Send in the rest of the regiment.
What happened to the warriors at Thermopylae?
Dead to the last man.
Algren-san
Son of a bitch thinks he can win.
They will bring two more regiments up here soon.
we won't be able to stop them again.
You don't have to die here.
I should've died so many times before.
Now you live again.
Yes.
It is not your time.
It's not over.
What is this?
Cannon, prepare to fire!
Prepare to fire!
This is madness. Is he going to attack?
Yes.
He is defeated. He must accept his shame.
Kill them back. All of them.
Now!
My horse!
Fire!
Ute!
Aim!
Aim!
Fire!
Fire at will!
Bring up the new guns!
Prepare the new guns!
Ute!
Backward!
Quickly! Quickly!
Fire!
Stop firing!
Idiots, keep on firing!
Stop firing! Stop!
No...
Shoot! Kill Katsumoto! Kill the American!
You have your honor again.
Let me die with mine.
Help me up.
Are you ready?
I will miss our conversations.
perfect...
They are all perfect.
On behalf of the United States of America, the signing of this treaty...
will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity...
and cooperation between our two great nations.
On behalf of the Emperor... we are pleased to have successfully concluded this...
...negotiation.
He is here?
Highness, if we could just conclude the matter at hand...
This is Katsumoto's sword.
He would have wanted you to have it...
...that the strength of the Samurai be with you always.
Enlightened One, we all weep for Katsumoto, but...
He hoped, with his last breath...
...that you would remember the ancestors who held this sword...
...and what they died for.
Your Highness.
You were with him at the end?
Hai. (Yes)
Emperor, this man fought against you.
Your Highness, if you believe me to be your enemy. Command me...
and I will gladly take my life.
I have dreamed of a unified Japan.
...of a country strong and independent and modern...
and now, we have railroads, and cannons, western clothing.
But...
we cannot forget who we are...
...or where we come from.
Ambassador Swanbeck...
I have concluded that this treaty is not in the best interests of my people.
Sir, if I may...
So sorry, but you may not.
This is an outrage!
Enlighted One, we should discuss this...
Omura...
...you have done quite enough.
Everything I have done, I have done for my country.
Then you will not mind when I seize your family's assets...
...and present them as my gift to the people.
You disgrace me.
If your shame is too unbearable...
I offer you this sword.
Tell me how he died.
I will tell you how he lived.
And so the days of the Samurai had ended.
Nations, like men, it's sometimes said, have their own destiny.
As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him.
Some say he died of his wounds.
Others...
...he returned to his own country.
But I like to think, he may have at last found some small measure of peace...
...that we all seek, and few of us ever find.
This is Bandit One starting prep sequence, cleared for takeoff.
Full engine start.
This is Bandit One. I'm easing her up.
- Are we transmitting yet? - Not yet.
Rodgers, Orin, how's the perimeter?
It's clear.
Bandit One receiving signal. Approaching target vector.
Transmitting to base now, sir.
- The place is secure. - Good. Now we keep it that way.
- Take the left flank, Hargs. - Sir.
Was that him?
I don't know. Let's check it out.
- Talk to me. - We got the bogey on the run, sir.
Which way?
Rodgers, which way?
- Which way, Rodgers? - Cannot identify, sir.
Is he jamming our frequency?
- Looks like it, sir. - You're supposed to be jamming his.
This is Bandit One, homing in on target vicinity.
Hightop. Hightop!
I want you to hold this position. Nobody gets in. You got that?
Got it, sir.
Closing to zero mark center.
Still on approach vector.
Sir, sir, he's here. The Painter's here, sir!
Damn!
Over target signal.
Target is lit. I'm going in.
Got it. Locking on. Flares away.
Too easy, Naish.
Way too easy.
Damn it.
Training mission is over, and the Painter does it again.
Returning to base now.
What are you doing here?
Wait here. Be quiet.
Where's your mommy and daddy, huh?
Okay, come on.
Drive.
Thank you for organizing this in such short notice, everyone.
As I'm sure you can appreciate, we've had a serious situation...
...come up over the last 12 hours in southern Russia...
...which requires our immediate attention.
General lgor Zaysan...
...an iron fist from the Brezhnev days, Afghanistan, the southern states.
Over the last few years he resurfaced in Chechnya.
He made good use of the rebels, considering he's a Russian.
He put together a new army, new weapons.
And now it seems, quite possibly, a nuke.
Yesterday, he led a band of his rebels across the Terek River...
...and captured the Kamshev nuclear plant.
Now, three of the four reactors...
...at Kamshev have been decommissioned.
The fuel rods have been removed from the fourth reactor...
...but it is capable of going online if it is re-cored.
This would appear to be a Russian problem, Mr. Tensor.
Please, general, let us make no mistake.
Gentlemen...
...lgor Zaysan is a very dangerous man.
We have been tracking him for a number of years.
His hatred for the Kremlin has become a complete obsession.
What's this?
- What are you doing with them? - They are prisoners.
They surrendered when we moved into the plant.
Where are you taking them?
Exactly my point.
If he is capable of re-coring this reactor...
...he is capable of detonating it.
That is to say, potentially 100,000 deaths in an instant.
And a few hundred thousand more when the winds...
...send the fallout over an area the size of Texas.
We have proof he's capable of all this?
Amanda, pull up the Flintov picture.
This surveillance photograph was taken in North Korea.
The Asian is John Lee Kim.
He's the ace of hearts in our deck of most-wanted arms dealers.
The man with him is Andre Flintov...
...Zaysan's second in command.
Now, it seems that Flintov has plutonium on his shopping list.
What has Uncle Kim got for sale?
Fuel rods from a failed North Korean reactor.
We have to destroy the Kamshev plant...
...before Zaysan re-cores it.
- Is the package moving? - Yes.
Will they know what's in it?
The Americans will have their intelligence, and they'll act on it.
You'll see.
We are not in the business of doing Russia's dirty work.
It's not just the Russians, there are seven scientists...
...from the private sector working at Kamshev...
...four of whom are Americans. - How the hell did they get there?
The Russians hired them to help decommission the plant.
- Are they still alive? - We're not sure.
One of them, Arthur Moffit...
...has stayed in contact with Moscow by cell phone.
Latest report suggests he's managed to stay hidden from Zaysan's troops.
So let me get the bottom line here.
We've got a nuclear reactor to take out...
...hostages to rescue, and it's all on us.
Unfortunately, the Russians have lost control on this one.
As you know, Mr. Secretary...
...they are not averse to our support in this.
What do you propose?
An air strike.
We level the place.
- The hostages... - Four or five lives...
...against 100,000. I can accept that.
General, we're not able to do a large-scale bombing here.
- How come? - The area is too contaminated.
Unless we do a precise air strike, we risk sending huge clouds...
...of radioactive dust into the nearby town.
Well, from what I know, these reactors aren't easy to take out.
We need to target its weak spot.
What we need is a painter.
- Send in a painter with a Ranger team. - I agree.
They could secure the hostages and choose a precise target.
It could get real difficult over there.
I have to persuade the president that this plan could work.
Do we have any guys with real combat experience?
No, we need someone who's been through this before.
This man can do it.
Well, I can't see it like that.
I just can't see how you'd look at it any other way.
- We had our asses kicked. - Oh, fuck that.
One man don't make a team.
No, he ain't nothing without his high-tech shit.
Yeah? I'd like to see you say that to his face.
Oh, fuck you. I say what I want to who I want.
Even the captain?
Yeah.
See, we're a team.
We don't hold our piss, even for captain.
Well, all I know is, he beat every one of us.
That's gotta count for something.
- What's up, captain? - We gotta go.
We got two suits from D.C. Flying in to give us our mission.
- What, tonight? - Yeah.
Let's go.
We got a mission.
They're asking for you.
This is the USS Oakla.
We're in position and conducting maneuvers.
Will advise upon operation commencement.
These just came in from our agent in Dagestan.
Anshan lmports, one of John Lee Kim's companies.
The shipment's from Namp'o, North Korea?
- Do we know what it is? - Certainly big enough for fuel rods.
The Russians have promised to keep an eye on its movement.
And to stop it once the situation's stabilized.
We better have one of our guys keep an eye on it too.
It's imperative we take out that last reactor...
...before this container gets there.
It's amazing.
Even old Viktor lvanov's given us his blessing.
Come in.
- Excuse me, Mr. Ivanov. - Yes, Beslan?
The prime minister is ready for us.
Okay.
Amanda, Jonathan, good to see you.
- You too, major. - This is Captain Naish.
He leads the Ranger team we're sending in.
- Good to meet you, captain. - I know you've been fully briefed.
So you know what you're up against, I thought you better hear this.
It might prove critical. Can you run that for us?
Sure. Sergeant.
The rebels came in and found the others, about five.
Me and Valentina are still in the hospital.
You've got to get us out of here. Please, get us out of here.
They're back.
That's the voice of Arthur Moffit...
...the lead scientist on the decommissioning team.
- How do you know if he's still alive? - We don't.
The rebels haven't even acknowledged that they've taken hostages.
The fact is, we haven't even made contact.
And you think they're gonna re-core this reactor?
So far, everything points in that direction.
Good luck, captain.
Gentlemen.
What's my primary target, the hostages or the reactor?
Both.
If there's a choice, which one takes priority?
What are my orders, ma'am?
The reactor.
Is that it? You wanna say anything more to me?
The briefing's over.
Damn it, you can talk to me.
I'm still here for you.
Look, if you want a psych evaluation, you can read the file.
You wrote it.
It's still there, the same look in your eyes.
What look would that be, the one you saw in the inquiry?
That's not fair.
What do you want from me, Amanda, a thank-you?
Okay, thank you.
You cleaned my record.
Means nothing to those people buried in the ground.
It wasn't your fault.
I took the order. I lit the target.
That mission was over years ago.
Those deaths are in the past. Leave them behind.
That's a good idea.
Prime minister, hello.
Have you heard from the Americans?
They want a rescue and a preemptive air strike.
- They say it is in our best interests. - Of course they would.
Their newfound obsession has been exhilarating for them.
They are asking for us to counter with a ground attack.
We can't make that promise.
Then lie.
Let them believe they're in charge.
The blame rests on their shoulders.
Has Zaysan found...
...what he's looking for? - It's on its way to him as we speak.
We must let the Americans take out the reactor.
I'll tell the president.
That reactor's got reinforced concrete.
Sure there's a good spot to take it out?
I'll find one.
The spec shows a narrow target area for it to implode.
It's all about minimal damage on this op.
We go in, locate the hostages, paint the target...
...and then get out before anyone knows we're there.
Any questions?
Yeah. Well, how close on our ass is the air strike?
They'll be right on our ass. That's why we gotta make it quick.
Well, how hot is it around the reactor site?
A small company of Zaysan's loyalists are protecting his ass there.
The rest of the rebel troops are across the river, 20 miles south.
Captain, this being a stealth op and all...
...we gotta leave Orin behind.
You can see his fat ass a mile away.
Go blow yourself, asshole.
Quit it. Let's pack and roll, people.
- Jacks here. - What is happening now?
We're moving forward.
The team's on its way.
We have a man shadowing the container.
Our forces are ready to intercept it.
Have them hold off until the plant is secured...
...or those hostages are as good as dead.
Hey, Hargs. Man, I did some checking on him.
Total malfunction in Bosnia.
He painted the wrong target.
We're talking major collateral damage.
Yo, what's your name? What do we call you?
Yeah.
What's your name, dude?
If it comes to having to save your ass, I wanna know your name.
Worry about saving your ass, I'll worry about saving mine.
All right, people, let's roll.
We're losing the signal.
Must be on a real ride.
Those are 70-mile-an-hour wind gusts.
Is there a problem, major?
I hope not.
Ready to deploy chutes on my mark.
Mark.
Chutes open.
Off the target.
Well, there's nothing more we can do to help them now.
They're on their own up there.
Painter.
Hargs.
I took a local reading, sir.
Their comsets are down.
Well, they were due east of us. So let's pack and go.
Sir.
This way.
- Morning, Mr. Secretary. - Morning, John.
We have a green light, sir. The team's on the ground.
When will the target be lit?
Two hours, at most.
One of our satellites will pick up the Painter's signal.
We have an F-14 standing by off a carrier in the Gulf.
They're waiting for a go-ahead.
And the Russians have coordinated...
...a offensive move to coincide with the strike.
Keep me informed, and keep everything on track.
- Yes, sir, we certainly will. - Good luck.
Thank you, sir. Bye-bye.
Captain Jack Stevens, skipper of the Oakla.
- Lt. Randall, sir. - Lt. Carter, sir.
Colonel Reynolds gave me some details about your mission.
In fact, too few.
I was impressed with your flight record...
...particularly on the F-14 Tomcat. I do see that you're carrier-qualified.
But what I don't see is why a Navy pilot can't fly this mission.
The way we see this little get-to, it's an Army problem.
So the Army ought to be the one to clean it up.
- Not good enough, lieutenant. - The dispatch from Col. Reynolds...
...explains the parameters of this operation, the need for secrecy.
I don't give a damn about dispatch, lieutenant.
If I'm gonna entrust my airplane to an Army pilot...
...and let him fly in harm's way, then by God, I wanna know why.
Yes, sir.
I know the terrain, I know the ground crew.
You could let a naval aviator fly this operation...
...but the Army needs me.
- Fair enough, lieutenant. - Roger that, sir.
This looks like the hospital.
The reactor's less than a mile away.
Go. Go.
Moffit says he was hiding in the hospital.
He's here.
Got it going again for you, sir.
- Great. - But Harg's set's dead.
- Damn. - What do we do now?
This way. This way.
Go. Go with them.
Hargs, stay close to the Painter.
Sir.
Rodgers, Orin, upstairs.
Hightop, cover the lobby.
I got the morgue.
How come that don't surprise me?
Clear up here.
Your nerves shaky?
Yeah, a little.
Good. Means your instincts are turned on.
- I found them. - Please don't hurt us.
Please don't hurt us.
Nobody's gonna hurt you. Come with me. Go on, let's go.
Go, go, go. This way.
Go.
We got bogeys. Three of them, coming right at me.
- Who's she? - Valentina Bakoff, my coworker.
- Where are the others? - We don't know.
There were seven of us working here when the soldiers came.
I think they were in the breeder reactor.
- Where were you? - Working in the cooling tower...
...with her. - How did you get there?
There's underground pipe ways that connect to the reactors.
When we got here, soldiers were wrecking the medical center.
- And we hid. - Who's the woman in the morgue?
- What woman? - One with the hole in the head.
- We don't know. - How do we get through those pipes?
Through the morgue.
Hightop, pull back.
You know her?
She worked with us.
Come on.
Okay, it's clear.
- Which way? - Left.
Check upstairs.
There's nothing here but a stinking woman.
Let's go see Flintov.
This is it.
This is the entrance to reactor number three?
- You sure? - Absolutely.
Go.
Orin, Hightop, stay with the civilians.
Son of a bitch.
Shit, that makes seven.
We're moving out.
We can't just leave them here.
He's right, captain. These are Americans.
I don't like it either, but we gotta make evac. That's five klicks away.
We got no time to be carrying bodies.
Leave the dead.
Let's move out.
You know the right target?
Do you?
Just do your thing, Painter.
Move out, Hargs.
We have confirmation. The target is lit.
The countdown starts now, gentlemen.
We have a go for extraction. Repeat, we have a go for extraction.
Prep the chopper on pad five.
Yes, sir, we copy. We'll just be waiting for a call.
All right, Helo One, you're cleared for takeoff.
We'll see you on the other side.
Roger that, Mother.
Contact Wingate Field, report status to Colonel Reynolds.
So tell me, how long did you?
Still no contact. Radio silence maintained.
Evac operation still on schedule.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
I told you.
Stay awake. Stay awake.
How much further?
Marking time on 0345 hours.
Evac's at 0500 hours.
Painter, don't be late.
Jacks here.
- Good morning. How are you? - Fine.
- And you, Mikhail? - Waiting for news.
- What is happening? - Less than an hour to evac.
- But no word? - They're still under radio silence.
Look, there's another call I have to take.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can, okay?
Okay.
Amanda, you better get in here.
The target's set and the chopper's inbound.
This is it.
Painter, this is Naish.
- Painter, this is Naish. Do you copy? - Roger that, Naish.
I'm one klick to your rear and closing fast.
Everything's cool.
Let's break some fucking radio silence.
Raptor, this is Big Bad Wolf. Do you read?
This is Raptor. Wolf, what's your situation?
Piggies assembled and one is on his way.
- What's his E TA? - Fifteen minutes, at most.
Copy that. What about the prize?
Two onboard, five fatalities pre-extraction.
- Final approach, Wolf. - Copy that, Raptor. Over and out.
Get ready.
Let's move.
Let's move. Get in! Hargs, move it. Let's go, fast.
This is too easy.
Much too easy.
We got a problem.
- What problem? - I think we're being set up.
- What's wrong? - He thinks we've been set up.
- Grenade! - Grenade!
- Where is it?! - Get it out! Get it out! Let's go!
It's gonna blow! It's gonna blow!
Where is it?
- Hands up. Don't move. - Hands up! Hands up!
Stay where you are.
You, don't move!
Stand still.
Jesus Christ. That crazy bitch could've killed me.
We are grateful to you, Mr. Moffit.
Let's keep them alive...
...for now.
To work.
Hey, you.
Hey, come on.
You. Quickly, move!
Still tracking fuel rods.
Truck is one hour away from destination.
You're not gonna like this, sergeant.
This is what's left of the chopper's operation recording.
This is Raptor. Wolf, what's your situation?
Piggies assembled and one is on his way.
- What's his E TA? - Fifteen minutes, at most.
Copy that. What about the prize?
Two onboard, five fatalities pre-extraction.
Final approach, Wolf.
And then a minute and 51 seconds pass...
...before Naish and the others were loaded onboard.
What the hell...?
- Grenade! Get it out! Get it out! - Where is it?!
Let's go! It's gonna blow! It's gonna blow!
Get out! Move your asses! Move!
What should we report?
The evac was compromised.
Rescue aircraft destroyed.
Personnel?
Presumed dead.
Proceed with the air strike.
F-14 strike force is on deck, sir.
Weapons are locked and loaded and ready to fly.
All right, let's get 207 and 209 into the air, gentlemen.
Get off me.
What happened?
You were just to watch them and make sure they got out as planned.
One they left behind may have figured out those plans.
- Where is he now? - We don't know.
If he gets to the Russians, we're screwed.
- He won't. - But your men...
...have spent half a day looking for him already.
Calm down, Mr. Moffit. He won't get to the Russians.
What about these Americans? Did they make contact?
No. Valentina made sure of that.
We've blocked the frequency in the area.
I doubt that he'll be able to make any radio contact anymore.
Put him in with the others.
Move!
Painter, this is Hargreaves. Do you copy?
Painter, this is Hargreaves. Do you copy?
We had a deal. I set you up.
I put everything in its place the way you wanted.
We appreciate your sacrifices, Mr. Moffit.
You wanna wipe out your Chechen army, fine...
...but I'm not supposed to be here when the place is taken out.
I'm touched by your deep sense of self-interest.
You promised me the money and safe passage.
You're absolutely right. Safe passage.
This is Shadow One. We're on course, bearing three mark seven.
Godspeed, Army.
Our friend in Moscow will tell us if the American makes contact.
Put guards at the place he targeted.
Take everything apart, brick by brick.
What makes you think he will come here...
...and not contact the girl?
He's American.
He's probably watching us now...
...planning his next move.
- We got a problem. - What problem?
- That's the best you're gonna get. - It's not enough.
We need to know what happened on that evac.
Run it back.
- Jacks here. - Try a high filter.
- Hello? - Amanda.
It's you. What's going on?
Listen, we gotta talk this thing through.
All right, listen to me. Just you and me...
...nobody else. You understand?
You're the only one I trust.
Something's off about this mission.
I don't know who's pulling the strings there, but I think we're being set up.
Did you set the target?
Yeah, but I'm gonna set a secondary.
- Amanda? - Give me that.
What the hell is going on?
- Tensor? - What happened on the evac?
Put Amanda back on.
Soldier, talk to me.
Talk to me.
I just...
I don't get it.
We were on the chopper, and we were clear to go.
Why would they wait until then to try and waste us?
It was all too easy. We just waltzed on in there like we owned the place.
Yeah, no shit.
And these fuckers played us.
I mean, what the fuck is going on here, captain?
Let's just concentrate on trying to get us out.
Yeah, right.
Take a look around. I don't think so.
- He said something wasn't right. - Did he give you any proof?
No.
We have to call off the fighter until we figure out what's going on.
- It's not happening, Amanda. - You heard what he said.
I don't think you're an accurate judge in this situation...
...not considering your past relationship with him.
- What's that got to do with it? - You're too close to him.
Anyone reasonable would see...
...that there is absolutely no substance to what he's saying.
Look...
...when the evac chopper went down, he probably got spooked.
You and I both know, in those kinds of situations, people's nerves get tested.
- Nerves? - That is all it is, Amanda.
Mikhail? I need to ask you a question.
Please, go ahead.
Have you noticed anything strange about this op?
How do you mean?
I can't quite explain it.
Does this have anything to do with your call to the Painter?
- You know about that? - Your intelligence...
...is our intelligence today. Remember?
But I do believe something is strange, as you said.
Minister lvanov is beside himself with this matter.
- In what way? - After your helicopter was destroyed...
...I told him there may be a delay.
I said it would be a good thing, give us time to intercept the container...
...and justify extreme measure of an American air strike on Russian soil.
But he look at me as... As if I spit in his face.
What are you trying to say, Mikhail?
Look again at the pictures I sent you of the reactors.
I'm going to send someone to intercept those planes.
Okay.
Just to let you know, the Russians are setting up to stop the truck.
Secondary target, just in case.
Hey there. Just got your e-mail. What is this?
The nuke plant in Chechnya. It's from a Russian satellite.
Shitty quality.
What do you see?
Am I looking for something in particular?
- I don't know. - Okay.
Hello.
Somebody's been Photoshopping.
- Where? Show me. - This shadow.
Whatever's casting it's been erased.
Can you check and see if this was covered by one of our satellites?
Sure. We'll see what we have on the date the Russians shot this...
...and the computer will overlay the two...
...and identify any discrepancies.
Is that what you're looking for?
Oh, my God. The truck's already been there. We're following a decoy.
Get me hard copies.
You're violating Russian airspace. Stand down.
We have clearance from the Russian government.
That's not what we were told.
He's trying to lock on. These guys are going hot.
Let's see if he can catch me now.
- He's still on our 6. - I know a few tricks. We'll lose him.
Going for weapons lock.
Almost there.
Fire fox one, fire fox one.
Hold on, hold on. Got another.
I see him. Hang on, hang on!
- We're losing power. - Put your poker face on, Randall.
Just play a little Texas Hold'em.
- He's got a lock. - Not for long. Hang on.
That's more like it.
I almost got a lock.
Fire fox two.
This is Shadow One. Hostiles taken care of.
Hello. May I help you?
I'm sorry, I was looking for Mikhail Beslan.
Mr. Beslan has been reassigned.
Are you sure?
Any inquiries about Mr. Beslan should be placed with the Ministry of Defense.
Thank you.
Painter, this is Hargreaves.
I'm in the tunnel. I got bogeys down here.
- Yeah. - Everything is in place, sir.
Have they stopped the truck?
Yes, sir. We have the men starting to open it now.
- Let me know when they open it. - Yes, sir.
Hi. The radiation suits are in the car.
Hargs, stay put. I'll find you.
There he is! Let's go!
I know where they're being held. Go, go!
Give me Jonathan Tensor.
The Painter was on to something, so was Beslan.
And now he's been reassigned.
All right.
Convince me.
Painter said he thought it was a setup.
Amanda, that could mean anything.
What if lvanov planned this whole thing?
What if he set us up to go in like cowboys, thinking...
...we were taking out a reactor before Zaysan could re-core it...
...only, it's already been re-cored.
That's what they're unloading off this truck.
What could lvanov possibly gain from something so insane?
He's a hard-liner.
He's fallen in with the new Russia, but he doesn't like it. We know that.
Imagine what would happen if we hit a live reactor.
It'd be hundreds of thousands dead.
Think where the blame would fall, the country that caused it...
...and the country that allowed it to happen.
And political control of Russia would be up for grabs.
Something has been bothering me from the start.
Usually you have to drag everything out of the Russians...
...but this time they handed it to us.
And every bit of it was through Viktor lvanov.
I give you this, it's crazy enough to be possible...
...except for one small detail. - What's that?
The Russians stopped the container an hour ago.
From the outside, it tested positive for radioactive levels.
The specialists are in the process of opening it now.
Don't look so devastated.
I think your assumptions are reasonable.
You're doing a terrific job, Amanda.
Everybody's very impressed.
This is it. They're being kept inside.
Right there.
We gotta get out of here.
The fighter's about to enter Russian airspace.
- How long till we hit the target? - Thirteen minutes.
Still on approach. ETA from target zone: 12 minutes.
Get away! Don't touch it!
There could be static on your hand.
It could shorten out the target.
Everyone will understand your sacrifice, Andre.
I'll make certain of it.
Soon, this pathetic Chechnya will be a forgotten wasteland.
And our Mother Russia will be great again.
The guards are dead. The Americans have escaped.
It's time.
Don't worry.
I will make sure nobody comes here.
Pull back. Pull back. Come on.
We gotta get 1000 yards away from that reactor.
Naish, keep your men moving. I'll catch up.
Stay clear of the village hall.
- What are you talking about? - It's where I lit the secondary target.
Who the hell told you to light a secondary target?
This mission was off. Primary target was a setup.
What the fuck are we standing around here for?
- Our orders were for us... - To target a dormant reactor.
- This one has a live core in it. - A what?
They used the hostages to re-core the third reactor before we got here.
Dead hostages had edema in their eyes.
- The fuck is edema? - First signs of radiation sickness.
I hadn't figured it out until I saw...
...that we were being shadowed on the way back to the evac.
Moffit did lead us through like we owned the place.
Look, we played right into Zaysan's fucked-up plan.
Now, I gotta deactivate that primary core.
No, man. We ain't changing the op because you got a hunch.
I guess you're gonna have to shoot me, huh?
I gotta do what's right.
- I'm out of here, captain. - Rodgers.
Sir, I think he's right.
Go.
There is another container in the truck.
Well, get it open.
Now acquiring target coordinates. Locking on to signal.
Target is in that dome right there.
How you gonna deactivate it?
Electrical charge shuts it down.
Missile gets diverted to the secondary target.
Well, we're not getting through that.
How much C-4 did you pack up?
How long till firing now?
- Six minutes, sir. - Very good.
Still on approach vector.
Hold this position. I'm going up top.
I can hold them up from here, sir.
Take out the jeep!
- How much time now? - Less than two minutes.
Missile is armed and hot.
What? What the hell you talking about?
What is it?
Someone irradiated dead pigs.
It's the container.
We gotta call off the fighter.
Do it.
Missile away.
Too late. The missile's on its way.
Oh, my God.
Target is down.
Secondary is hot.
What secondary target?
No!
That son of a bitch did it.
You look like shit too.
Amanda, what is it?
That was the Kremlin. Viktor lvanov is dead.
They're saying it's suicide.
It looks like he's been set up to take the fall.
If the missile hadn't diverted, the Kremlin would be in chaos.
God knows how deep this really goes.
I'll be leaving for Washington in the morning.
They'll call you in for your account pretty soon.
Just like old times.
Not quite the same.
This time you'll have to say you went against orders.
I listened to my instincts. So did you.
- They'll investigate my part, I'm sure. - Yeah.
Well, when they do...
...piece of advice from my experience:
Don't get too close to the person asking the questions.
Is that so?
Yeah.
Because when you do...
...then they're gonna have to answer to me.
My flight's not for eight hours.
That's a long time.
The Sun is the superpower of our Solar System,
a thermonuclear blast furnace, erupting with massive explosions.
It can be the same amount of mass as mount Everest
coming out from the Sun and flying out into space.
At 93 million miles away it would seem that we are safe from the Sun's wrath.
But, are we?
It matters, especially in modern times,
what the Sun is doing.
From the center of the Sun, as it rotates around,
is the "kill zone".
With some experts predicting the most violent outbreak of solar activity
in modern history.
it�s never been more important to understand
the secrets of the Sun.
There are billions of stars in the Universe
but one alone dominates our cosmic neighborhood:
the Sun.
It's an infernal sphere, of mostly hydrogen and helium,
superheated into a plasma, that burns at millions of degrees.
Its surface reages with violent explosions,
as it spews out storms of deadly radiation, millions of miles into space.
Our Sun is a type of star known as a yellow dwarf.
Yellow because of the colour of its surface,
and dwarf because it's small for a star.
But small is relative.
Within its boundaries, you could fit one million earths.
In our Solar System, there's simply no bigger star than the Sun.
At a million miles across, it's a massive celestial blockbuster.
The Sun is really pretty huge.
It dominates our Solar System.
Not only is the bigger star of the Solar system,
it's the only star in the Solar System.
It's sorrounded by a bunch a smaller stuff,
that we call planets and comets and moons.
But the Sun is our star.
Our star is an enormous source of heat and energy.
It has a surface temperature of 10,000� Farenheit.
And generates 380 billion billion megawatts of power.
This dwarfs anything on the human scale.
Hoover Dam in Nevada only generates 280 megawatts.
In one second the Sun churns out more energy
than has been used in all of human civilization.
All that power in the blink of an eye.
Incredibly, it's been burning this way for billions of years.
Early astronomers didn't quite understand how
the Sun could generate so much energy for that long a period of time.
That was the first mistery, it was really how the Sun generates its energy.
In the early nineteenth century,
scientists assumed that the Sun worked just like any fire on Earth,
that there was a source of fuel, perhaps coal, that was slowly burning away.
But that was a serious problem with this theory:
I've got a fire in front of me here,
if I want it to keep burning, I have to keep adding wood to it.
This fire will last maybe an hour, unless I add some more wood.
Now, if I had a pile of the wood the size of the whole Sun,
and somehow enough oxygen to burn it,
it would only take about 5000 or 6000 years to burn out.
That's a long time, but it's not long enough to sustain life on Earth.
By the early twentieth century,
carbon dating of Earth rocks and fossils had proven
that the Sun was in existence and at temperatures warm enough to sustain life
not for thousands of years, but for 3 billion.
If you wanted to build a fire that would last that long,
you would need 72 trillion cords of firewood.
That's 12,000 cords for each man, woman and child on the planet.
Clearly, there had to be some other process,
unknow on Earth, that was powering the Sun.
In the 1920's scientists found the answer to the puzzle,
in a process that would later be harnessed to fuel the hydrogen bomb.
Nuclear fusion.
Fusion occurs when atoms are smashed together at a high rate of speed
and literally fused. To get this to happen,
conditions have to be just right.
For any interaction to happen, these two protons, each has
a positive electric charge and so they would repell each other,
so you got to get them close enough together.
And to do that, it's got to be hot, which means
the particles are moving fast, and dense enough that they, they hit each other
and they can get close enough together so they actually fuse.
The core of the Sun is the perfect cauldron for nuclear fusion.
It's the hottest place in the Solar System, at a sweltering 27 milion �F.
And it's also incredibly dense.
It's so dense, it's ten times the density of lead,
and you would think at that density it should be a solid, but it's not
because it's so hot that remains a plasma.
If you heat a gas to high enough temperatures
electrons fall off of the atoms and they float around in the soup.
And so it has behavior that's different from what a gas would do,
hence we have a different word for it, we call it plasma.
To truly understand what goes on in the core of the Sun,
you have to find some way to imagine the almost "unimaginable".
In addition to studying the Sun, I also play pool
and the Sun is a place where there are billions of particles,
colliding and interacting with each other.
And it is really not unlike a cosmic pool table, on an unimaginable scale.
It doesn't matter how hard you hit a ball.
You would never hit hard enough to actually
fuse that ball together with another ball.
But there's so much pressure and such high density at the core of the Sun,
that two objects impacting each other, will actually fuse.
In the Sun, these objects are hydrogen atoms,
flung together by immense pressure, to form helium atoms.
In this fusion process, the resulting atom is slightly less massive
than the ones they created it.
The missing mass is given off as energy.
Each second, inside the Sun, 600 million tons of hydrogen are fused
into 595 million tons of helium.
That five million tons of mass lost in the process is converted into energy
equal to one billion one megaton hydrogen bombs.
That's every second.
When you look out into the cosmos,
the process that gives you the highest return of energy
for free, is what goes on in the centers of stars like the Sun.
So, we now know that the Sun is powered by nuclear fusion.
It's the only fuel we know,
that can sustain the burning in the Sun long enough
to sustain life on Earth, billions of years.
Sunlight.
It's so central to life that we don't often give it a second thought.
But how light gets from there to here, turns out to be an incredible story.
The energy created in the fusion process is carried out of the core
by particles of light and heat called photons.
They are what bring the warming rays of the Sun to Earth.
To reach our planet, these glowing travellers from our nearest star
must first take a long winding road through all the layers of the Sun,
like Dante journeying through the levels of Hell.
First, a photon enters the 185,000 mile-thick radiative zone.
The region is so densely packed
that the photon constantly bumps into other particles,
like hydrogen and helium atoms.
It struggles outward in a chaotic zigzag
pattern that scientists call the "random walk".
A photon can't escape without interacting over and over and over again,
getting absorbed by atoms and reemitted
and it can be absorbed and reemitted millions of times.
As the density decreases as you get further up in the Sun,
it becomes easier and the collisions and the interactions are less.
When it finally reaches to within 130,000 miles of the surface,
the photon enters the convective zone,
and the pace suddenly quickens.
It's carried upwards by a kind of boiling,
riding along in huge columns of gas at hundreds of miles an hour,
taking only ten days to emerge on the solar surface.
The incredible journey is almost over
as the photon lifts off through the wispy gasses of the solar atmosphere.
From there, it takes only 8 minutes
for it to zip across 93 million miles of space
to our planet.
Incredibly, by the time sunlight actually reaches Earth,
it's already been in existence
for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years.
For the Sun even a million years is a small blip in time.
The simple perfect disc of a sunset,
belies the long, violent history of our star.
It is a ball of fire spawned billions of years ago
in a massive explosion known as a supernova.
After this titanic explosion where a star much larger than the Sun exploded,
there would have been a huge cloud of gas many times larger than the Solar System.
And small nods of material would have gradually coalesced
in this very large cloud.
About five billion years ago,
some ten billion years after the Big Bang
that scientists believe kickstarted our Universe,
this cloud started to collapse under the pull of gravity.
Our Solar System probably arose from one such nod
of self gravitating gas that pulled itself together
and gradually spun itself up
as it pulled in, like a skater pulling her arms in during a spin,
until the star and the various planets coalesced around it.
Ultimately, when the star was dense enough, it would have turned on
fusion, started glowing and giving off sunlight.
Why do scientists believe the Sun was born from the ashes of a supernova?
The evidence lies beneath our feet.
Complex heavy elements
like the uranium we mine from the Earth to fuel our nuclear powerplants,
could not have been forged in the Sun,
there is simply not enough heat in a star of that size
to create elements any heavier than iron.
Heavy elements, like uranium,
can only be created in a catastrophic cosmic explosion.
Earth and the other planets in the Solar System
formed out of the same nod of gas that produced the Sun.
In this process the Sun hoarded 99% of the mass.
This means it's the biggest object in our celestial neighborhood,
with the strongest gravitational pull.
That's why everything else revolves around it.
Of all the planets, Earth earned a privileged place in relation to the Sun.
If we were closer in,
our oceans would boil away and the ground would be hot enough to melt lead.
If we were farther out, our planet would be a frozen wasteland.
It's a sort of like Goldylocks and the Three Bears,
not too hot, not too cold, it's just right.
Here we are at about 93 million miles away
from the Sun and we're happy to be here, we're lucky to be here.
In some sense we're here because it's the right circumstance for us to be here.
Earth may be in just the right place in the Solar System,
but we're also close enough to the Sun to be a target of its fury.
Buzz Lightyear mission log.
All signs point to this planet as the location of Zurg's fortress...
but there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.
Come to me, my prey.
To infinity and beyond!
To infinity and beyond!
So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.
Not today, Zurg!
Not today, Zurg!
Oh, no!
- No! No, no, no, no, no!   - Oh! You almost had it.
- I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!      - Sure you will, Rex.
- In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am.   - But look at my little arms!
I can't press the fire button and jump at the same time!
Where is it, where is it? Where is it?
- Uh, Woody?   - Huh?
Oh! Hang on, cowboy.
- Woody, are you all right?   - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, Buzz.
Okay, here's your list of things to do while I'm gone.
Batteries need to be changed. Toys at the bottom of the chest need to be rotated.
Oh, and make sure everyone attends Mr. Spell's seminar on what to do if you or part of you is swallowed.
- Okay<i>?</i> Okay. <i>G</i>ood, okay. - Woody, you haven't found your hat yet, have you<i>?</i>
No! And Andy's leaving for cowboy camp any minute, and I can't find it anywhere!
Don't worry, Woody. In just a few hours you'll be sitting around a campfire with Andy...
making delicious hot ''sch'moes.''
- They're called s'mores, Buzz. - Right. Right. Of course.
- Has anyone found Woody's hat yet<i>?</i> - Keep looking, men! Dig deeper!
Negatory! Still searching!
The lawn gnome next door says it's not in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'.
It's not in Molly's room. We've looked eve<i>ryw</i>here.
- I found it! - You found my hat<i>?</i>
Your hat<i>?</i> No! The missus lost her earring.
- Oh, my little sweet potato! - Oh, you found it!
Oh, it's so nice to have a big, strong spud around the house.
Oh, great. That's just great. This'll be the first year I miss cowboy camp, all because of my stupid hat.
- Woody, look under your boot. - Don't be silly. My hat is not under my boot.
- Would you just look<i>?</i> - Oh! You see<i>?</i> No hat.
-<i>J</i>ust the word ''Andy.'' - Uh-huh.
And the boy who wrote that would take you to camp, with or without your hat.
I'm sorry, Bo. It's just that I've been looking fo<i>RW</i>ard to this all year.
-It's my one time with just me and Andy.   -You're cute when you care.
Bo, not in front of Buzz.
Let him look.
Miss Peep! Your sheep!
<i>H</i>e<i>y, kids, this is Al fnoAM Al's Toy Bann</i> <i>and I'AM sittin'on soAM</i>e <i>good d</i>e<i>als h</i>e<i>n</i>e.

For cryin' out loud, it's this one!
- I despise that chicken.  - Fellas!
Fellas! Okay, I got some good news and I got some bad news.
- <i>G</i>o ahead, tell us!  - What news<i>?</i>
- The good news is, I found your hat, Woody.      - My hat! Oh!
Slink, thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Where'd you find it<i>?</i> - Well, that's the bad news.
- Oh! It's Buster! - Canine alert!
Man your battle stations! Let's move, move, move!
Woody! Hide, <i>q</i>uick!
Okay, okay, okay. Okay! Okay! You found me! Buster! All right!
- Hey, how did he do, Hamm<i>?</i> - Eh, looks like a new record.
Okay, boy, sit.
Reach for the sky.
<i>G</i>otcha!
Ohh! <i>G</i>reat job, boy.
Who's gonna miss me while I'm gone, huh<i>?</i>
Who's gonna miss me<i>?</i> Who's gonna miss me<i>?</i>
- Andy, you got all your stuff<i>?</i> - Okay. Have a good weekend, everybody.
- I'll see you Sunday night. - It's in my room!
Stick 'em up!
I guess we'll work on that later.
-Hey, Woody. Ready to go to cowboy camp<i>?</i> -Andy, honey, come on.
- Five minutes, and we're leavin'. - Five minutes. Hmm.
Help, help! Somebody help me!
Let her go, evil Dr. Pork Chop!
Never! You must choose, Sheriff Woody.
How shall she die<i>?</i> Shark, or death by monkeys<i>?</i>
- Choose!  - I choose Buzz Lightyear!
- What<i>?</i> That's not a choice! - To infinity and beyond!
- I'll save you, Miss Peep!   - My hero!
- Thanks, Buzz.   - No problem, buddy.
You should never tangle with the unstoppable duo of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!
Oh, no.
Andy, let's go!  Molly's already in her car seat.
- But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped.  - Oh, no.
- Maybe we can fix him on the way. - No,just leave him.
I'm sorry, honey, but you know toys don't last forever.
- What happened<i>?</i>  - Woody's been shelved.
Andy.
- Woody<i>?</i>  - Woody<i>?</i>
Honey, are you okay<i>?</i>
Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy! Whoo!
- He's back<i>?</i> Hey, everybody!  - Yeah, giddy-up! Yeah, giddy-up!
- Andy's back! He's back early from cowboy camp! - Places, everybody! Andy's comin'!
Hey, Woody, did you miss me<i>?</i>
<i>G</i>iddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up!  Ride 'em, cowboy!
Oh. I forgot. You're broken.
I don't wanna play with you anymore.
No! Andy! No!  No, Andy, no!
Andy! Andy! Andy!
Bye, Woody.
No, no! Andy!
No, no! Andy!
- Wheezy, is that you<i>?</i>  - Hey, Woody.
What are you doing up here<i>?</i> I thought Mom took you to get your s<i>q</i>ueaker fixed months ago.
- Andy was so upset.      - Nah.
She just told him that to calm him down and then put me on the shelf.
- Well, why didn't you yell for help<i>?</i>   - Well, I tried s<i>q</i>ueakin'.
But I'm still broken.   No one could hear me.
Besides, the dust aggravates my condition.
What's the point in prolonging the inevitable<i>?</i>
We're all just one stitch away from here to there.
''Yard sale.''  Yard sale<i>?</i>
Yard sale! <i>G</i>uys, wake up, wake up!  There's a yard sale outside!
- Yard sale<i>?</i>  - Sarge! Emergency roll call!
Sir, yes, sir! Red alert!  All civilians fall in position now!
Single file!  Let's move, move, move!
- Hamm. - Here. - Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs. - Here.
Troikas. Check. Check, check, check, check.
- I hate yard sales. - Slinky.
Someone's coming!
Okay, let's see what's up here.
Bye, Woody.
Wheezy! Oh, come on. Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think-- Oh!
Hey, here, boy!   Here, Buster! Up here!
No. No, no--    No, no, no!
Okay, boy, to the yard sale!  Hyah!
- What's goin' on<i>?</i> - Woody! - He's nuts! - His arm ain't that bad.
Don't do it, Woody!   We love you!
Careful on the steps now.
- Hi. Can I help you<i>?</i>  - Okay, boy, let's go.  And keep it casual.
Not that casual.
- Piggy bank comin' through. Comin' through. - Hey, let me see.
- Is he out there<i>?</i> - Can you see him<i>?</i> - There he is.
- Oh! He's getting in the box!   - He's sellin' himself for 25 cents!
-Oh, Woody, you're worth more than that. -Hold on, hold on, hold on. He's got something.
- It's Wheezy! - Wheezy<i>?</i> - Wheezy<i>?</i>
Hey! It's not suicide!  It's a rescue!
<i>G</i>ood boy, Buster.  Hold still.
- There. There you go, pal.  - Bless you, Woody.
All right, now,  back to Andy's room. Hyah!
- Way to go, cowboy.  - Yea, Woodster!   - <i>G</i>olly bob howdy!
Woody! I-I'm slippin'!
Mommy! Mommy, look! Look at this!   Mommy, look, it's a cowboy dolly!
- Hey, that's not her toy!   - No, no, no, no, no!
- What's that little gal think she's doin'<i>?</i> - Mommy, Mommy!
- Can we get it, please<i>?</i> Mommy,please<i>?</i> - Oh, honey, you don't want this toy. It's broken.
<i>Th</i>e<i>n</i>e<i>'s a snak</i>e <i>in AMy boot.</i>
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest! Hmm. A little rip. Fixable.
Oh, if only you had your hand-stitched, polyvinyl hat!
I found him!  I found him, I found him!
Buster! Quiet down!  Excuse me. Can I help you<i>?</i>
- Uh, how much for all this stuff<i>?</i>       - Yeah, you can help take his paws off my pal.
I'll give you, eh, 50 cents  for all this junk.
- Oh, now, h-how did this get down here<i>?</i>   -<i>J</i>ust hand her the sheriff.
- Oh, a pro.   - Nice and easy.
- Very well. Five dollars.   - I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.
- Now just walk away.   - Wait!
- The other way.    - Uh, I'll give you 50 bucks for him.
- Fifty bucks ain't bad.     - It's not for sale.
Everything's for sale.     O-Or trade.
- Uh, you like my watch<i>?</i>  - Sorry.   - He's safe.
- Way to go, Andy's mom!   - Whew. That was close.   - All right! She showed him.
- But, lady--   - Molly, don't touch that, please.   - Lady. Lady. Lady!
Yeah, go home, Mr. Fancy Car.
- Oh. - Hold on. - What's up<i>?</i> - Molly<i>?</i>
- What is it, Buzz<i>?</i> - Molly! I'll be right here, sweetie.
- Oh! What now<i>?</i> - What's happening down there<i>?</i> - What's goin' on down there<i>?</i>
- What's he doin'<i>?</i>  - I can't watch!
- Can someone cover my eyes<i>?</i>  - Oh, no. He's stealing Woody!
- What<i>?</i>  - Stealin'-- W-Wait!  - He can't take Woody! It's illegal!
- Where's he goin'<i>?</i> - Somebody do somethin'!
Buzz!
<i>G</i>et him, Buzz.
Okay, where's the red jacket<i>?</i>
Why would someone steal Woody<i>?</i>
All right, let's review this one more time.
At precisely 8:3 2-ish, Exhibit ''A''-- Woody-- was kidnapped.
Exhibit '' B'': composite sketch of the kidnapper.
Exhibit '' B'': composite sketch of the kidnapper.
- Nah, that's not him. - He didn't have a beard like that.
Fine. Uh, Etch, give him a shave.
- The kidnapper was bigger than that.    - Oh, picky, picky, picky.
Let's just go straight to Exhibit '' F'': the kidnapper's vehicle.
Now, the vehicle fled the scene in this direction.
Your eyes are in backwards. It went the other way.
- Hey, put a cork in it. - How do you spell FBI<i>?</i>
- My crime scene! - Oh, why don't you watch where you're goin', ''<i>G</i>odspilla''<i>?</i>
- I didn't know there was a crime scene. - Excuse me. Excuse me.
A little <i>q</i>uiet, please. Thank you.
Lazy toy brain.
Lousy try, Brian.
- What are you doing, Buzz<i>?</i> - There was some sort of message encoded on that vehicle's I D tag.
- Liz try bran. - It's just a license plate. It's just a jumble of letters.
Yeah, and there are about 3.5 million registered cars in the Tri-County area alone.
Lou's thigh burn.
Oh, this can't help. Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys.
Toy. Toy. Toy! Hold on!
Huh<i>?</i>
Al's Toy Barn.
- Huh<i>?</i> - Al's Toy Barn<i>?</i>
Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit.
- It's the chicken man! - That's our guy.
I knew there was somethin' I didn't like about that chicken.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be right there.
And we're gonna do this commercial in one take. Do you hear me<i>?</i>
Because I am in the middle of something really important!
You, my little cowboy friend, are gonna make me big buck-buck-bucks.
Andy.
I can't believe I have to drive all the way to work on a Saturday.
All the way to work!
What<i>?</i> Whoa!
Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy! Stop it!
Sit, I said! Whoa!
It's you! It's you! It's you, it's you, it's you!
- It's really you! - What's me<i>?</i>
- <i>Th</i>e<i>n</i>e<i>'s a snak</i>e <i>in AMy boot</i>! - Ha! It is you!
- Please stop saying that. - Prospector said someday you'd come.
Sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln! The Prospector! He'll wanna meet ya!
Say hello to the Prospector.
- I-It's a box. - He's mint in the box.
Never been opened.
Turn me around, Bullseye, so I can see.
Why, the prodigal son has returned.
It's you! It's you! You're here! It's you, it's you, it's you!
Okay, I'm officially freaked out now.
Oh, we've waited countless years for this day.
It's good to see you, Woody.
Listen, I don't know wh--  Hey, how do you know my name<i>?</i>
Everyone knows your name, Woody.
Why, you don't know who you are, do you<i>?</i>
Bullseye.
That's me.
Holy cow.

It's time for Sheriff Woody
He's the very best
He's the rootin'-est, tootin'-est cowboy in the wild, wild west
<i>Woody's Roundup</i>
I can't find it! It doesn't seem to be on any of these stations!
- Keep looking. - Oh, you're goin' too slow. Let me take the wheel.
- It's too fast. How can you even tell what's on<i>?</i> - I can tell.
- There it is! - We made it! - Back, back, back!
Too late. I'm in the 40s. <i>G</i>otta go 'round the horn. It's faster.
- Back! Back! - That's it!
-<i>And look fon th</i>e <i>giant chick</i>e<i>n</i>! - Now, Etch!
That's where I need to go.
You can't go, Buzz. You'll never make it there.
Woody once risked his life to save me.
I couldn't call myself his friend if I weren't willing to do the same.
So who's with me<i>?</i>
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes and your angry eyes,just in case.
This is for Woody when you find him.
All right, but I-- I don't think it'll mean the same coming from me.
Mr. Buzz Lightyear, you just gotta save my pal Woody.
I'll do my best, son.
Okay, fellas, let's roll.
<i>G</i>eronimo!
You'd think with all my video game experience I'd be feeling more prepared.
The idea is to let go.
We'll be back before Andy gets home.
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!
To Al's Toy Barn and beyond!

All right! All right! Next tape!
Hey, wait, wait, wait. What-- What happened<i>?</i> What happens next<i>?</i>
Come on! Let's see the next episode!
- That's it.   - What<i>?</i>
The show was canceled after that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What about the gold mine and the-- and the cute little critters and the dynamite<i>?</i>
That was a great show. I mean, why cancel it<i>?</i>
Two words: Sput-nik.
Once the astronauts went up, children only wanted to play with space toys.
I know how that feels. But still, my own show!
- I mean, look at all this stuff!. - Didn't you know<i>?</i>
- Why, you're valuable property! - Oh, I wish the guys could see this.
'' Hey howdy hey!'' That's me. I'm on a yo-yo.
Oh! Hey, nice teeth.
And yet, still a good-lookin' guy.
Oh! It's a bank. Cool!
Wh-Wh-What do you--you push the hat, and out co-- Oh, out come bubbles.
Clever.
Oh, wow! Hey, what's this thing do<i>?</i>
I get it. There's a snake in my boot.
Hey, Bullseye, go long. <i>G</i>o long!
A record player! Ha! Haven't seen one of these in ages.
- <i>Bulls</i>e<i>y</i>e--  - Okay, now slow.
Oh, that's funny, Bullseye!
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!
- Oh! - Not bad.
Oh! Hey, look at us! We're a complete set!
Now it's on to the museum!
Museum<i>?</i>
- What museum<i>?</i>  - The museum.
We're being sold to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.
- That's in <i>J</i>apan! -<i>J</i>apan<i>?</i>
No. No, no, no, no, no, no. I can't go to<i>J</i>apan.
-What do you mean<i>?</i> -I gotta get back home to my owner Andy.
- Hey, look, look. See<i>?</i> - He still has an owner.
Oh, my goodness.
No. Can't go.
I can't do storage again. I just can't!
-<i>J</i>essie!<i>J</i>essie! - I won't go back in the dark!
Wh-What's the matter<i>?</i> What's wrong with her<i>?</i>
Well, we've been in storage for a long time waiting for you.
- Why me<i>?</i> - The museum's only interested in the collection if you're in it, Woody.
Without you, we go back into storage.
- It's that simple. - It's not fair! How can you do this to us<i>?</i>
Hey, look, I'm sorry, but this is all a big mistake.
- You see, I was in this yard sale--           - Yard sale<i>?</i>
- Why were you in a yard sale if you have an owner<i>?</i>         - Well, I wasn't supposed to be there.
-I was trying to save another toy when--      -Was it because you're damaged<i>?</i> Hmm<i>?</i>
- Did this Andy break you<i>?</i>       - Yeah, but-- No! No, no, no!
- It was-- It was an accident. I mean-- - Sounds like he really loves you.
It's not like that, okay<i>?</i> And I'm not going to any museum!
Well, I'm not going back into storage!
- Al's coming! <i>G</i>o! <i>G</i>o on,<i>J</i>essie! - Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
Jessie, look at me. I promise you'll come out of the box. Now go! <i>G</i>o!
It's show time!
Money, baby. Money, money, money.
And now, the main attraction.
No! His arm! Where's his arm<i>?</i>
Oh, no. No, no, no, no!
Oh, what am I gonna do<i>?</i> Oh, I know. I know.
Come on, come on, come on, pick up the phone.
- <i>H</i>e<i>llo.</i> - It's me! It's Al! I got an emergency here!
- <i>W</i>e<i>ll, I'AM busy.</i> - Yes, we're all busy, but-- Look, it has to be tonight.
- <i>What</i>? <i>You'v</i>e <i>got to b</i>e <i>kidding.</i> - All right, all right!
But first thing in the morning.
It's gone! I can't believe it! My arm is completely gone!
All right, come here. Come on. Let me see that.
Oh, it's just a popped seam. Easily repaired.
- You should consider yourself lucky. - Lucky<i>?</i> Are you shrink-wrapped<i>?</i>
- I am missing my arm! - Big deal.
Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy is dying to play with a one-armed cowboy doll.
Why,<i>J</i>essie, you know he wouldn't last an hour on the streets in his condition.
It's a dangerous world out there for a toy.
Uh, all right, nobody look till I get my cork back in.
Good work, men. Two blocks down and only nineteen more to go.
- What?     - Nineteen?  - Nineteen?   - Are we gonna do this all night?
- My parts are killing me.     - Come on, fellas.
Did Woody give up when Sid had me strapped to a rocket?
- No.    - No!
And did he give up when you threw him out of the back of that moving van?
- Oh, you had to bring that up.        - No, he didn't!
We have a friend in need, and we will not rest until he's safe in Andy's room.
Now let's move out!
And that concludes our broadcast day.
Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.
Oh, come on. You don't wanna help me. I'm the bad guy.
You're gonna go back in storage because of me, remember? Now just go.
Bullseye--  All right, all right.
But you have got to keep quiet. Now come on.
Over here. Attaboy.
Okay, Bullseye, upsy-daisy.
Bullseye, cut it out. Stop it. Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.
Woody's Roundup. Come on, it's time to play
What? No, officer, I swear! What?
Oh, get in there. There you go. Cheap case.
- Where's the remote? Where is the remote<i>?</i>
- Why don't I put it in the same place every-- Oh, here it is.
What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry I can't help you guys out.
Really, I am. But you didn't have to go and pull a stunt like that.
- What, you think I did that?   - Oh, right, right.
Yeah, the TVjust happened to turn on, and the remote magically ended up in front of you.
- You callin' me a liar<i>?</i> - Well, if the boot fits--
Say that again.
If the boot fits.
Okay, cowboy.
How do ya like that? Take it back! Take it back!
Don't think just 'cause you're a girl I'm gonna take it easy on ya.
Jessie, Woody! You stop this at once!
I don't know how that television turned on...
but fighting about it isn't helping anything.
- If I had both my arms--     - Well, the fact is, you don't, Woody.
So I suggest you just wait until morning.
- The cleaner will come, fix your arm-- - And then I'm outta here.
Oh, no, no. Bullseye. Don't take it that way. It's just that Andy--
Andy, Andy, Andy. That's all he ever talks about.
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?
May I remind you that some of us are carrying over six dollars in change.
Losing health units. Must rest.
- Is everyone present and accounted for?    - Not quite everyone.
- Who's behind?      - Mine.
Hey, guys. Why did the toys cross the road?
- Not now, Hamm.     - Oh, I love riddles. Why?
To get to the chicken on the other side.
- Yippee!    - The chicken!
- Oh, well, we tried.    - We'll have to cross.
What the-- You're not turning me into a mashed potato.
I may not be a smart dog, but I know what roadkill is.
There must be a safe way.
Okay, here's our chance. Ready, set, go!
Drop!
Go.
Drop!
I said drop!
Go!
Drop!
Go!
Ah, that went well.
Good job, troops. We're that much closer to Woody.
Oh, thank goodness you're here.
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?
So, uh, how long is this gonna take?
You can't rush art.
Oh, no. It's closed.
We're not preschool toys, Slinky. We can read.
Hey,Joe, you're late. We got a ton of toys to unload in the back.
- All right, all right. I'm comin', I'm comin'. - Come on! Let's get movin'!
- All right, let's go.     - But the sign says it's closed.
No, no, no, no. All together. Now!
Whoa, Nelly. How are we gonna find Woody in this place?
Look for Al. We find Al, we find Woody. Now move out.
- Woody! - Woody!
There you go.
He's for display only. You handle him too much, he's not gonna last.
It's amazing! You're a genius! He's just like new!
I could use one of those.
You know, they make it so you can't defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.
It's extortion, that's what it is. Hey, I always thought the golden sceptre was the only--
- I thought we could search in style. - Nice going there, Hamm.
So how about letting a toy with fingers drive?
Am I really that fat?
- Ow! What are you doing?    - You're in direct violation of code 6404.5...
stating all space rangers are to be in hypersleep until awakened by authorized personnel.
- Oh, no.    - You're breakin' ranks, ranger.
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. I've got an AWOL space ranger.
- Tell me I wasn't this deluded.   - No back talk!
I have a laser, and I will use it.
You mean the laser that's a lightbulb?
Has your mind been melded? You could've killed me, space ranger.
Or should I say ''traitor''?
- I don't have time for this.   - Halt! I order you to halt!
Listen to me. Listen. Wait, wait, wait.
- We've been down this aisle already.     - We've never been down this aisle. It's pink!
- Face it-- we're lost.  - Ooh! Back it up, back it up.
What a great party!
How low can you go? How low can you go?
- Excuse me, ladies.
Does anyone know where we might find  the Al of Al's Toy Barn<i>?</i>
I can help.
I'm Tour Guide Barbie.
Please keep your hands, arms and accessories inside the car, and no flash photography.
-Thank you.  -I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud.
Then make room for the single fellas.
To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle.
Developed in 1 967, the original series had 1 6 cars, including the Corvette.
Uh, beg your pardon, ma'am, but where's Al's office?
Please hold all questions until the end of the tour. Thank you!
It says how you defeat Zurg! Look!
- Hey, Rex! - Excuse me, sir!  - Get this outta here, ''geekosaur.''
- Look out! - Oh, stop, stop, stop!
Turn into the spin, Barbie!
My source of power! No! Come back!
Hey! Wait up! Hey! Come on!
Slow down! Dinosaur overboard!
- Slow down--    - Remain seated, please!
Ow! Listen to me! Listen to me! You're not really a space ranger!
You're a toy! We're all toys! Do you hear me?
Well, that should hold you till the court-martial.
Let me go! You don't realize what you're doing!
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.
Back in 1 995, shortsighted retailers did not order enough dolls to meet demand.
- Hey, Buzz! - Halt! Who goes there?
- Quit clownin' around and get in the car.      - Buzz! Buzz!
- I know how to defeat Zurg!      - You do?
- Come on. I'll tell you on the way.    - No, no, guys!
You've got the wrong Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz!
Say, where'd you get the cool belt, Buzz?
Well, slotted pig, they're standard issue.
No!
It's like printing my own money.
Yeah, what? Oh, Mr. Konishi.
Yes, uh, I-I have the pictures right here.
Yes, uh, I-I have the pictures right here.
In fact, I'm in the car right now on my way to the office to fax them to you.
I'm goin' through a tunnel! I'm breakin' up!
Oh, wow, will you look at me? It's like I'm fresh out of the box!
Look at this stitching. Andy's gonna have a hard time ripping this.
Hello! Hi! Hello!
Great. Now you can go.
Well, what a good idea.
Woody, don't be mad at Jessie.
She's been through more than you know.
Why not make amends before you leave, huh?
It's the least you can do.
All right. But I don't know what good it'll do.
Hey, what you doin' way up here?
I thought I'd get one last look at the sun before I get packed away again.
Look,Jessie, I know you hate me for leaving, but I have to go back.
I'm still Andy's toy.
- Well, if you knew him, you'd understand. You see, Andy's a--  - Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid...
and to him you're his buddy, his best friend...
and when Andy plays with you it's like...
even though you're not moving...
you feel like you're alive...
because that's how he sees you.
- How did you know that? - Because Emily was just the same.
She was my whole world.
When some body loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart
And when she was sad
I was there to dry her  tears
And when she was happy
so was I
When she
Loved me
Through the summer and the fall
We had each other
That was all
just she and I together
Like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that
she loved me
so the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone
still, I waited for the day
When she'd say
I will always love you
Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
But she smiled at me and held me
just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me
When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart
When she
When she
Loved me
Loved me
You never forget kids like Emily...
or Andy.
But they forget you.
-Jessie, I-- I didn't know. -Just go.
How long will it last, Woody?
How long will it last, Woody?
Do you really think Andy is going to take you to college...
or on his honeymoon?
Andy's growing up...
and there's nothing you can do about it.
It's your choice, Woody.
You can go back, or you can stay with us and last forever.
You'll be adored by children for generations.
Who am I to break up the Roundup gang?
- Hey, Woody, are you in here? - Nah. This one's empty too.
- Woody!
- Pardon me, gentlemen, but have either of you seen a cowboy doll with a bad arm?        - Hey, Woody!
- Why, no, I haven't.    - Hey! He was talkin' to me!
- No, he was talkin' to me!   - Why, you-- I'll--
You see, all along we thought the way into Zurg's fortress was through the main gate.
But in fact, the secret entrance is to the left, hidden in the shadows.
To the left and in the shadows.Got it.
- It's Al!   - Someone's coming.    - Everyone take cover.
No, it was a big pileup, but I don't want to bore you with the details.
Yes. Now, let me confirm your fax number.
- 0 1 1-- - W-W-Wait. Slow. That's a lot of numbers.
-555--   - No, I got it.
- It's him. - The chicken man.
- Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.   - That's the kidnapper, all right.
A kidnapper. An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one.
And the piece de resistance.
I promise the collection will be the crown jewel of your museum.
- That's Woody.    - Now that I have your attention...
imagine we added another zero to the price, huh?
- I no can </i>e! <i>Y</i>e<i>s,y</i>e<i>s,y</i>e<i>s,y</i>e<i>s</i>! - What<i>?</i>
- I pay anything you want. Anything.    - Yes! Yes!
You got a deal! I'll be on the next flight to Japan!
Quick, get into the poultry man's cargo unit. He'll lead us to Zurg. Move, move, move.
Don't touch my mustache!
Al, you are rich! Rich, rich, rich!
Destroy Buzz Lightyear!
Destroy Buzz Lightyear! Destroy Buzz Lightyear!
- He didn't take the bag!    - No time to lose!
He's ascending in the vertical transporter.
All right, everyone, hang on. We're gonna blast through the roof.
- Uh, Buzz? - To infinity and beyond!
What are you, insane?  We're wasting time.
Stand still, Godzilla.
I-I don't understand. Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry.
- Blast! He's on level 23. - How are we gonna get up there?
Maybe if we find some balloons we could float to the top.
Are you kidding<i>?</i> I say we stack ourselves up, push the intercom and pretend we're delivering a pizza.
How about a ham sandwich with fries and a hot dog<i>?</i>
- What about me? - Eh, you can be the toy that comes with the meal.
Troops, over here!
Just like you said, lizard man. ''In the shadows to the left.''
Okay, let's move!
Mission log. Have infiltrated enemy territory without detection...
and are making our way through the bowels of Zurg's fortress.
You know, I think that Buzz aisle went to his head.
Oh, no. Which way do we go?
- This way.    - What makes you so sure?
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.
We've been detected. The walls! They're closing in!
- Quick, help me prop up vegetable man, or we're done for! - Hey! Hey!
- Put me down, you moron.    - Hey, guys, look! It's not the walls!
It's the elevator!
Come on. We've got no time to lose. Everyone, grab hold.
Uh, Buzz, why not just take the elevator?
They'll be expecting that.
Hey, Buzz! Stop!
Slow down!
To overnight six packages to Japan is how much?
- What? That's in yen, right?       - No, dollars.
Dollars! Oh! You are deliberately taking advantage of people in a hurry. You know that?
All right, I don't-- I don't-- I-- Look, I'm-- I'll do it! All right, fine!
I'll have the stuff waiting in the lobby, and you'd better be here in 1 5 minutes...
because I have a plane to catch.
- Do you hear me?
We're finally going! Can you believe it?
That's custom-fitted foam insulation you'll be ridin' in, Bullseye.
First class all the way.
You know what? I'm actually excited about this.
I mean it. I really am.
- And why shouldn't you be? - Yee-hah!
swing youn pantnen, do-si-do Look at you, dancing cowboy!
Look! I'm doin' the box step.
Uh-oh. Hey, heads up down there.
Whoa! Pork bellies are fallin'.
Hey! How much farther, Buzz?
Halfway there.
My arms can't hold on much longer!
- Buzz, help! - Too heavy.
What was I thinking? My antigravity servos!
Hang tight, everyone. I'm going to let go of the wall.
- What?    - He wouldn't.
- One.     - He would.
- Two.   - No, don't, Buzz!
Three!
To infinity...
and beyond!
Approaching destination. Reengaging gravity.
Area secure.
It's okay, troops. The antigravity sickness will wear off momentarily.
Now let's move.
Remind me to glue his helmet shut when we get back.
Movietown News presents Spotlight on Adventure.
What you are now witnessing
is footage never before seen by civilized humanity,
a lost world in South America.
Lurking in the shadow of majestic Paradise Falls,
it sports plants and animals undiscovered by science.
Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit?
Why, oursubject today, Charles Muntz!
The beloved explorer lands his dirigible, the Sport of Adventure,
in New Hampshire this week,
completing a yearlong expedition to the lost world
This lighter-than-air craft was designed by Muntz himself
and is longer than 22 prohibltion paddy wagons placed end to end.
And here comes the adventurer now
Never apart from his faithful dogs,
Muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort
It's a veritable floating palace in the sky,
complete with doggy bath and mechanical canine walker
And, Jiminy Cricket, do the locals consider Muntz the bee's knees
And how!
Adventure is out there!
But what has Muntz brought back this time?
Gentlemen, I give you the monster of Paradise Falls!
And, golly, what a swell monster this is!
But what's this? Scientists cry foul
The National Explorer's Society accuses Muntz
of fabricating the skeleton
No!
The organization strips Muntz
of his membership
Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls
and promises to capture the beast alive!
I promise to capture the beast alive,
and I will not come back until I do!
And so, the explorer's off to clear his name
Bon voyage, Charles Muntz,
and good luck capturing the monster of Paradise Falls!
Here's Charles Muntz
piloting his famous dirigible
He hurdles Pikes Peak
He hurdles the Grand Canyon
He hurdles Mount Everest
He goes around Mount Everest
Is there nothing he cannot do?
Yes, as Muntz himself says, "Adventure is"
Adventure is out there! Look out!
Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!
Must get Spirit of Adventure over Mount Rushmore!
Hold together, old girl. How're my dogs doing?
A engines ahead full! Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.
Rudders 18 degrees towards the south
It's a beautiful day. Winds out of the east at 10 knots
Visibility unlimited. Enter the weather in the logbook.
Oh! Theres something down there. I will bring it back for science
Aw! Its a puppy! Ah! No time! A storm! Lightning Hail.
What are you doing?  Ahhh!
Don't you know this is an exclusive club?
Only explorers get in here,
not just any kid off the street with a helmet and a pair of goggles.
Do you think you've got what it takes? Well, do you?
All right, you're in. Welcome aboard
What's wrong? Can't you talk?
Hey, I don't bite
You and me, we're in a club now
I saw where your balloon went. Come on, let's go get it.
My name's Ellie
There it is
Well, go ahead
Go on.
Ow.
Hey, kid!
Thought you might need a little cheering up.
I got something to show you
I am about to let you see something
I have never shown to another human being.
Ever! In my life!
You'll have to swear you will not tell anyone.
Cross your heart. Do it!
My Adventure Book
You know him
Charles Muntz, explorer
When I get big, I'm going where he's going,
South Amerca, It's like America but south
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time"
I ripped this right out of a library book
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there and park it right next to the falls.
Who knows what lives up there
And once I get there?
Well, I'm saving these pages for all the adventures I'm gonna have.
Only I just don't know how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls
That's it. You can take us there in a blimp!
Swear you' take us, cross your heart!
Cross it! Cross your heart! Good, you promised. No backing out
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!
Adventure is out there!
You know, you don't talk very much
I like you!
Wow
Hah!
Stevie, throw me a deuce!
Quite a sight, huh, Ellie?
Uh Mails here
Shady Oaks Retirement. Oh brother
Hmm
Hey Morning, Mr Fredricksen. Need any help there?
No.  Yes!
Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house.
Well, just to let you know,
my boss will be happy to take this old place off your hands,
and for double his last offer!
What do you say to that?
Uh, I take that as a "no", then?
I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear
You poured prune juice in his gas tank
Yeah, that was good. Here, let me talk to him
You in the suit. Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie!
I am not with him!
This is serious. He's out to get your house.
Tell your boss he can have our house
Really?  When I'm dead!
I'll take that as a maybe
Order now, you get the camera,
you get the printer, 4x optical zoom,
Schneider lens, photo printer, SD card
"Good afternoon, my name is Russell
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Trbe 54, Sweat Lodge 12
"Are you in need of any assistance today sir?"
No
I could help you cross the street.  No
I could help you cross your yard.  No
I could help you cross your porch.  No
Well, I gotta help you cross something
No, I'm doing fine
"Good afternoon, my name is Russell"
Kid Kd -"And I am a Wilderness Explorer
"in Tribe 54 Sweat Lodge 12"  Slow down. Kid!
"Are you in need of any assistance"  Thank you,
but I don't need any help! ' ...today, sir?"
Proceed
"Good afternoon"  But skip to the end!
See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges
You may notice one's missing. It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.
If I get it, I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer.
"The widerness must be explored!"
Caw, caw Raar!
It's gonna be great! There's a big ceremony,
and all the dads come and they pin on our badges.
So, you want to assist an old person?
Yep! Then I'll be a Senior Wilderness Explorer.
You ever heard of a snipe?  Snipe?
Bird. Beady eyes
Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas.
I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it If only someone could help me.
Me me! I'll do it!  I don't know. It's awfully crafty.
You'd have to cap your hands three times to lure it in
I'll find him Mr Fredricksen!
I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past
Two blocks down. Got it. Snipe
Here, snipey snipey
Bring it back here when you find it
Snipe!
Okay, keep her coming. Keep coming
And stop Stop Stop!
Why Hey Hey you!
What do you, what do you think you're doing?
I am so sorry sir.  Don't touch that
No, no, no. Let me take care of that for you.
Get away from our mailbox!  Hey Sir, I.
I don't want you to touch it!
Ow!
Steve, you're all right?
Sorry, Mr Fredricksen
You don't seem like a public menace to me. Take this.
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning, okay?
What do I do now, Ellie?
Morning, gentlemen
Good morning, Mr Fredricksen. You ready to go?
Ready as I've ever be
Would you do me a favor and take this?
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute
I wanna say one ast goodbye to the old place.
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir
That's typical. He's probably going to the bathroom for the 80th time.
You think he'd take better care of his house
So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls
Heh!
We're on our way, Ellie
Huh?
Hmm
Hi Mr Fredricksen. It's me, Russell
What are you doing out here, kid?
I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch,
but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse.
Please let me in
No
Oh alright, you can come
in
Huh
I've never been in a floating house before.
Goggles. Look at this stuff. Wow! You're going on a trip?
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time"
You're going to South America, Mr Fredricksen?
Don't touch that! You'll soil it
You know most people take a plane,
but you're smart because you will have all your TV and cocks and stuff.
Whoa, is this how you steer your house?
Does it really work?
Kid would you stop with the
This makes it go right.  Let go of that...
And that way's left.   Knock it off
Hey, look! Buildings
That building's so close, I could almost touch it
Wow! This is great!
You should try this, Mr Fredricksen
Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away!
Hey, I can see your house from here
Don't jerk around so much, kid Whoa!
Well, that's not gonna work
I know that coud. It's a cumulonimbus
Did you know that
the cumulonimbus forms
when warm air rises over cool air?
Stayed up all night blowing up balloons for what?
and that's how we get lightning
That's nice kid. Mr Fredricksen?
Theres a storm coming. It's starting to get scary.
We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble..
What are you doing over there?   Look
See? Cumulonimbus.
My pack!
Got ya!
I thought you were dead
What happened?
I steered us, I did, I steered the house
Steered us?
After you tied your stuff down, you took a nap.
So I went ahead and steered us down here
Yeah. Sure.
Can't tell where we are.
Oh we're in South Amerca all right
It was a cinch with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.
GP What?  My dad gave it to me
It shows exacty where we are on the planet.
With this baby, we'll never be ost!
Oops
Well get you down, find a bus stop,
you just tell the man you wanna go back to your mother.
Sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls
There. That ought to do it
Here I'll give you some change for bus fare.
No, I'll just use my city bus pass
Whoa. That's gonna be like a billion transfers
to get back to my house
Mr Fredrcksen, how much longer?
Well we're up pretty high, would take hours to get down.
That thing was building or something
What was that, Mr Fredricksen?
We can't be close to the ground yet
Wait! Wait, no don't! Don't don't!
Wait, wait Wait!
Russell, hang on. Hey.  Whoa Whoa!
Aaaagggghhhhh!
Walk back, walk back.  Okay
Come on. Come on.
Where, where are we?
This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
Don't worry Ellie, I got it
There it is
Ellie, it's so beautiful
We made it
We made it! Russell, we could float right over there! Climb up. Climb up!
You mean, assist you?
Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Okay. I'll climb up
Watch it!  Sorry
Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up!
Got it?
You on the porch yet?
What? That's it?
I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile?
Great.
Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge?
What are you talking about?  We could walk your house to the falls.
Walk it?  Yeah! After all, we weight it down.
We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon
Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly
with no rap music or flash dancing.  Uh-huh
We have three days, at best before the helium leaks out of those balloons
And if were not at the falls when that happens
Sand.  We're not getting to the falls
I found sand!
Don't you worry Ellie. We'll get our house over there.
This is fun already, isn't it?
By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted.
Oh, Mr Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated,
use the Wilderness Explorer call
Caw, caw Raar!
Wait, why are we going to Paradise Falls again?
Hey, lets play a game
It's called "see who can be quiet the longest."
Cool! My mom loves that game!
Damn thing!
Come on Russell. Would you hurry it up?
I'm tired and my knee hurts
Which knee?
My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom.
I asked you about that five minutes ago
Well, I didn't have to go then!
I don't wanna walk anymore. Can we stop?
Russell, if you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you
There are no tigers in South America Zoology
Oh for the love of Pete! Go on into the bushes and do your business.
Okay Here! Hold my stuff
I've always wanted to try this
Mr Fredricksen,
am I supposed to dig the hole before or after?
None of my concern!
Oh. It's before!
Bah! La la la la a!
Huh?
Tracks?
Snipe
Here, snipe. Come on out snipe
Snipe
Huh?
Ha Gotcha! Don't be afraid, little snipe
I am a Wilderness Explorer, so I'm a friend to all of nature
Want some more?
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out
Come on. Come on. Don't be afraid, little snipe
Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice
Giant snipe
I found the snipe!  Oh! Did you?
Are they tall?  Oh, yes, they're very tall.
Do they have a lot of colors?  They do indeed!
Do they like chocolate?  Oh yes... chocolate?
Gah! What is that thing?  It's a snipe!
There's no such thing as a snipe!
But you said snipes eat your Whoa!  Hey
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Careful, Russell!
Hey, look, Mr Fredricksen. It likes me. Whoa!
Russell. No, stop! That tickles.
Get out of here. Go on! Get!
Uh, oh No, no no! Kevin! It's okay. Mr. Fredrcksen is nice.
Kevin?  Yeah. That's his name. I just gave him.
Beat it! Vamoose! Scram! Hey! Thats mine!
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!
Go on! Beat it!
Can we keep him? Please?
I'll get the food for him, I'll walk him, I'll change his newspapers
No.
An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny mole"
That doesn't even rhyme. Yeah it does
Hey, look,Kevin.  What?
Get down! You're not allowed up there!
You come down here right now!
Sheesh!
Can you believe this, Ellie?
Ellie?
Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
She said for you to let me
But I told him no, I told you no!
N O.
I see you back there
Go on! Get out of here! Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while
Hey, are you okay over there?
Uh Hello?
Oh!
Hello, sir! Thank goodness
It's nice to know someone else is up here.
I can smell you
What? You can smell us?
I can smell you
Hey
You were talking to a rock
Hey, that one looks like a turtle
Look at that one! That one looks like a dog.
It is a dog!  What?
We're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment
Hey, I like dogs
We have your dog!
Whoa! Wonder who he belongs to.
Sit, boy. Hey, ook, he's trained. Shake
Uh- huh
Speak.  Hi, there
Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?
Oh yes
My name is Dug, I have just met you, and I love you.
My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master,
and he made me this collar so that I may talk. Squirre
My master is good and smart
It's not possible
Oh, it is,because my master is smart
Cool. What do these do, boy? Hey, would you
I use that collar...
to talk with I would be happy if you stopped.
Russell don't touch that! It could be radioactive or something!
I am a great tracker
My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself.
Have you seen a bird?
I want to find one, and I've been on the scent
I am a great tracker. Did I mention that?
Hey, that is the bird
I have never seen one up close, but this is the bird
May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner?
Yes, yes, take it and on the way, earn how to bark like a rea dog.
I can bark.
And here's howling
Can we keep him? Please, please, please!
No. But it's a talking dog!
It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the falls
Please be my prisoner
Oh please, oh, please be my prisoner!
Oh! Here it is. I picked up the bird's scent!
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is this?
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.
I'm getting prunes and denture cream! Who are they?
Oh, man, Master will not be pleased
We better tell him someone took the bird. Right, Alpha?
No
Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again
Find the scent, my compadres,
and you two shall have much rewardings
from master for the toil factor you wage.
Hey, Alpha, I think there's something wrong with your collar.
You must've bumped it
Yeah, your voice sounds funny!
Beta! Gamma! Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!
ALPHA: Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking
that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning.
No, no, no But maybe Dug would. You might wanna ask him.
Yeah, I wonder if he's found the bird on his very specia mission
Do not mention Dug to me at this time
His fool's errand will keep him most occupied. Most occupied indeed.
Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now?
Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself,
none of us will get a treat
You are wise, my trusted lieutenant.
This is Alpha calling Dug Come in, Dug.
Hi, Alpha Hey, your voice sounds funny
I know, I know! Have you seen the bird?
Why, yes. The bird is my prisoner now
Yeah, right!
Impossible! Where are you?
I am here with the bird,
and I will bring it back, and then you will like me.
Gotta go. Hey, Dug, who you talking to?
No, wait, wait!  What's Dug doing?
Why's he with that small mailman?
Where are they?
There he is. Come on!
Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!
That man there says. I can take the bird,
and I love that man there like he is my master.
I am not your master!
I am warning you once again, bird
Hey! Quit it. I am jumping on you now bird
Russell, at this rate we'll never get to the falls.
Here bird.
I am nobody's master, got it?
I don't want you here, and I don't want you here!
I'm stuck with you!
And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three...
A ball! Oh boy oh boy! A ball!
Ball? Yeah yeah? You want it, boy?
Huh? Huh? Yeah Yeah?
Yes, I do I do ever so want the ball
Go get it. Oh boy! Oh boy!
I will get it and then bring it back!
Quick, Russell Give me some chocolate
Why?  Just give it to me!
Bird Bird!
Come on Russell
Wait. Wait. Mr Fredricksen
What are we doing?
Hey, we're pretty far now, Kevin's gonna miss me
I think that did the trick
Hi, Master
Afternoon
Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie.
Which one's the front?
Oh boy
Is this step three or step five?
There.
All done That's for you
Oh...
Tents are hard
Wait. Aren't you superwilderness guy, with the GPMs and the badges?
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?
No. Alright. Here it goes.
I never actualy built a tent before. There, I said it
You've been camping before, haven't you?
Well, never outside
Well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent?
I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff
Well, why don't you try him sometime. Maybe he'll surprise you.
Well, he's away a lot, I don't see him much
He's gotta be home sometime
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much.
Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name?
Phyllis isn't my mom
Oh.
But he promised hed come to my Explorer ceremony
to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge.
So, he can show me about tents then, right?
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?
Don't wanna wake up the traveling flea circus.
Mr Fredricksen?
Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner.
We have to protect him
Can Kevin go with us?
All right, he can come
Promise you won't leave him?
Yeah. Cross your heart?
Cross my heart
What have I got myself into, Ellie?
Morning, sweetheart
We better get moving
Bird's gone
Maybe Russell won't notice. All right, everybody up!
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off! Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!
Find the bird, find the bird! Hi hi Point!
Look There he's!
Point!
Hey That's my food! Get off my roof!
Yeah get off of his
What is it doing?
The bird is calling to her babies
Her babies
Kevin is a girl?
Her house's over there in those twisty rocks
She has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them
Wait. Kevin is just leaving?
But you promised to protect her
Her babies need her. We gotta make sure they're together!
Sorry Russe. Weve lost enough time already
Yeah
This was her favorte chocolate
Because you sent her away, there's more for you
Huh?
Kevin?
Where's the bird? You said you had the bird.
Oh, yes. Oh yes
Since I have said that, I can see how you would think that
Where is it?  Uh. Tomorrow
Come back tomorrow, and then I will again have the bird. Yes.
You lost it! Why do I not have a surprised feeling?
Well, at least you now have led us to the small mailman
and the one who smells of prunes
ALPHA: Master will be most pleased we have found them
and will ask of them many questions. Come!
Wait! We're not going with you! We're going to the falls!
Get away from me!
Get down!
Stay!
You came here in that?
Uh yeah
In a house? A floating house?
That's the darnedest thing I've ever seen
You're not after my bird, are you?
But if you needed to borrow a cup of sugar
I'd be happy to oblige
Well, this is all a misunderstanding
My dogs made a mistake
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?
Yeah, well yes
THE Chares Muntz?
"Adventure is out there!"
It's really him! That's Chares Muntz!
It is? Who's Charles Muntz?  Him!
Yes! Yes That's him!  I'm Oarl Fredrcksen.
My wife and I, we were your biggest fans.
Oh we.  You're a man of good taste
Now, you must be tired. Hungry?
Uh- huh
Now, attention, everyone!
These people are no longer intruders! They are our guests
Follow me, I like you temporarily
You do smell like prunes
Whoa!
I will not bite you
The small mailman smells like chocolate
I'm sorry about the dogs
Hope they weren't too rough on you.  We weren't
Go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine
We're not actually going inside the Spirit of Adventure itself?
Oh...
Would you like to?
Would I?
Wait up Mr Muntz
Jiminy Cricket
Not you.  What do we do with Dug?
He has lost the bird. Put him in the Cone of Shame
I do not like the Cone of Shame.
Well, most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums,
New York, Munich, London. Of course I kept the best for myself.
Did you ever! Will you look at that?
Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium
Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth.
Used my shaving kit to bring him down
Oh yeah Well, surprise me
Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time
was to have it declared as denta equipment.
Oh, my gosh! The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!
Oh you recognize it. I'm impressed
That's an interesting story there
Excellent choice
I found it on safari with Roosevelt
He and I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings,
and did he cheat!
Oh he was horrible
Master, dinner is ready
Oh dear Broken translator
It's that loose wire again. There you go, big fella.
Thank you, Master
I liked his other voice
Well, dinner's served. Right this way
So, how are things stateside, huh?
Almost tempted to go back a few times,
but I have unfinished work here
Please. I hope you're hungry,
because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had
Oh Epsilon, you've done it again!
Yes!
Hey Hey!
Oh my Ellie would've loved all this
You know it's because of you she had this dream
to come down here and live by Paradise Falls.
I'm honored, and now you've made it
You're sure were not a bother? I'd hate to impose
No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests, a real treat
Treat. Where's the treat!  Treat
No, no Quiet! Calm down, calm down
I want a treat! I want a treat!  Hey!
I shouldn't have used that word
Having guests is a delight
More often I get thieves come to steal what's rightfully mine.
No!
They called me a fraud those
But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared
Beautiful, isn't it?
I've spent a lifetime tracking it
Sometimes years go by between sightings
I've tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives.
You can't go in after it
Once in, there's no way out
I've lost so many dogs
And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take.
But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place
Hey, that looks like Kevin
Kevin? Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.
I trained it to follow us
Follow you? It's impossible! How?
She likes chocolate.  Chocolate?
Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes gaga for it.
But it ran off. It's gone now
You know Carl, these people who pass through here,
they all tell pretty good stories
A surveyor making a map
A botanist cataloguing plants
An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls
I mean that's the best one yet I can't wait to hear how it ends
Well, it's been a wonderful evening, but we better be going.
Oh you're not leaving
We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality
Come on, Russell. But we haven't even had dessert yet
The boy's right. You haven't had dessert
Epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee.
Oh you really must stay, I insist
We have so much more to talk about
Kevin?
It's here
Get them!
Hurry!  I am hurrying!
Ahhh! They're coming!
Master over here
Go toward the light, Master!
Russell!
Get back!
DUG: Go on, Master! I will stop the dogs
Stop, you dogs
Whoa!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Caw, caw Raar! Caw, caw Raar!
Give me your hand!
Hang on to Kevin!
Kevin.
Oh no no, no Kevin. Stay down
She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home?
All right, but we gotta hurry
You lost them?
No, it was Dug
Yeah He's with them. He helped them escape!
Wait
Wait a minute Dug
See anything?
No. My pack s not following us Boy, they are dumb
This is crazy
I finally meet my childhood hero, and he's trying to kill us. What a joke!
Hey, I know a joke
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says,
"I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead"
Ha! It's funny because the squirrel gets dead.
Careful, Russell
You okay, Kevin?
You know what, Mr Fredricksen?
The wilderness isn't quite what I expected.
Yeah? How so?
It's kind of wild
I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book.
Get used to that, kid
My dad made it sound so easy
He's really good at camping
and how to make fire from rocks and stuff
He used to come to all my Sweat Lodge meetings.
And afterwards, we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.
I always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle.
Then we sit on this one curb right outside,
and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones,
and whoever gets the most wins
I like that curb
That might sound boring,
but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most
Look! There it is!
Hey, kid Hold on, Russell Stand still
Look at that bird go Wait up, you overgrown chicken.
That's it go, Kevin, go find your babies!
Run, Kevin Run!
Oh no!
Russell, give me your knife!
Get away from my bird!
No!
No!
Careful. We'll want her in good shape for my return
Let her go! Stop!
Kevin!
You gave away Kevin
You just gave her away
This is none of my concern. I didn't ask for any of this!
Master, it's alright
I am not your master!
And if you hadn't have shown up, none of this would've happened
Bad dog! Bad dog!
Now, whether you assist me or not,
I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me
