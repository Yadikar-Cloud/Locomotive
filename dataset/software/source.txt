You can create new notes to hold your ideas by selecting the "Create New Note" item from the Tomboy Notes menu in your GNOME Panel.
Your note will be saved automatically.
Then organize the notes you create by linking related notes and ideas together!  We've created a note called <link:internal>Using Links in Tomboy</link:internal>.
Notice how each time we type <link:internal>Using Links in Tomboy</link:internal> it automatically gets underlined?  Click on the link to open the note.</note-content>
<note-content>Using Links in Tomboy  Notes in Tomboy can be linked together by highlighting text in the current note and clicking the <bold>Link</bold> button above in the toolbar.
Doing so will create a new note and also underline the note's title in the current note.
Changing the title of a note will update links present in other notes.
This prevents broken links from occurring when a note is renamed.
Also, if you type the name of another note in your current note, it will automatically be linked for you.</note-content>

Benchmark
Benchmark Settings
Benchmark for each disk
Benchmarking involves measuring the transfer rate on various area of the device as well as measuring how long it takes to seek from one random area to another.
Please back up important data before using the write benchmark.
Benchmarking the write-rate of a disk requires exclusive access to the disk(e.g. the disk or its partitions cannot be mounted or in use) and involves reading data and then writing it back.
As a result, the contents of the disk is not changed.
If not checked, the write-part of the benchmark will not be done but on the other hand exclusive access to the device is not needed 
(the disk or device can be in use).

Déjà Dup Backup Tool
Déjà Dup Backup Tool requires at least version %d.%d.%.2d of duplicity.
but only found version %d.%d.%.2d
Déjà Dup is a simple backup tool.
It hides the complexity of backing up the Right Way (encrypted, off-site, and regular) and uses duplicity as the backend.
Déjà Dup needs to occasionally make fresh full backups.
This is the number of days to wait between full backups.

Unable to store a value at key '%s', as the configuration server has no writable databases.
There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file %s/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped.
If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help.
If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock.
Perhaps the problem is that you attempted to use GConf from two machines at once, and ORBit still has its default configuration that prevents remote CORBA connections - put "ORBIIOPIPv4=1" in /etc/orbitrc.
As always, check the user.* syslog for details on problems gconfd encountered.
There can only be one gconfd per home directory, and it must own a lockfile in ~/.gconfd and also lockfiles in individual storage locations such as ~/.gconf

"hddtemp" was not executed correctly, although it is executable.
This is most probably due to the disks requiring root privileges to read their temperatures, and "hddtemp" not being setuid root.
An easy but dirty solution is to run "chmod u+s %s" as root user and restart this plugin or its panel.

If you delete a file, it is permanently lost.
If you delete an item, it will be permanently removed
If you don't reload the applet, XfApplet plugin will go back to its initial empty state.
If you don't save the document, all the changes will be lost.
If you don't specify the --launch option, exo-open will open all specified URLs with their preferred URL handlers.
Else, if you specify the --launch option, you can select which preferred application you want to run, and pass additional parameters to the application (i.e.
for TerminalEmulator you can pass the command line that should be run in the terminal).
If you enable this option, the pattern will be searched in a case-sensitive manner.
The default is to use a case-insensitive search.
If you enable this option, the pattern will be treated as a regular expression and matched using the Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE).
Check the documentation for details about the regular expression syntax.
If you frequently create certain kinds  of documents, make a copy of one and put it in this folder.
Thunar will add an entry for this document in the "Create Document" menu.
You can then select the entry from the "Create Document" menu and a copy of the document will be created in the directory you are viewing.
If you know of anyone missing from this list; don't hesitate and file a bug on <http://bugzilla.xfce.org> .
If you remove the item from the panel, it is permanently lost.
If you revert the file, all unsaved changes will be lost.
If you save the document, all of the external changes will be lost.
If you select this option your choice will be remembered and you won't be asked again.
You can use the preferences dialog to alter your choice afterwards.

Error formatting disk
Are you sure you want to format the disk?
All data on the disk will be lost but may still be recoverable by data recovery services
<b>Tip</b>: If you are planning to recycle, sell or give away your old computer or disk, you should use a more thorough erase type to keep your private information from falling into the wrong hands
All data on the disk will be overwritten and will likely not be recoverable by data recovery services
<b>WARNING</b>: The Secure Erase command may take a very long time to complete, can’t be canceled and may not work properly with some hardware.
In the worst case, your drive may be rendered unusable or your system may crash or lock up.
Before proceeding, please read the article about <a href='https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase'>ATA Secure Erase</a> and make sure you understand the risks

# An introduction about JavaAcript
About the JavaScript language and the environment to develop with it.
# An Introduction to JavaScript
Let's see what's so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with it, and what other technologies play well with it.
## What is JavaScript?
*JavaScript* was initially created to "make web pages alive".
The programs in this language are called *scripts*.
They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
Scripts are provided and executed as plain text.
They don't need special preparation or compilation to run.
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).
When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript".
But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother" of Java would help.
But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called [ECMAScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), and now it has no relation to Java at all.
Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called [the JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine).
The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a "JavaScript virtual machine".
Different engines have different "codenames".
For example:
- [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) -- in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
- [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) -- in Firefox.
- ...There are other codenames like "Chakra" for IE, "JavaScriptCore", "Nitro" and "SquirrelFish" for Safari, etc.
The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet.
We'll use them too.
For instance, if "a feature X is supported by V8", then it probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
Engines are complicated.
But the basics are easy.
1.The engine (embedded if it's a browser) reads ("parses") the script.
2.Then it converts ("compiles") the script to machine code.
3.And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.
The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process.
It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.
## What can in-browser JavaScript do?
Modern JavaScript is a "safe" programming language.
It does not provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.
JavaScript's capabilities greatly depend on the environment it's running in.
For instance, [Node.js](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.
In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:
- Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
- React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
- Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) and [COMET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)) technologies).
- Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
- Remember the data on the client-side ("local storage").
## What CAN'T in-browser JavaScript do?
JavaScript's abilities in the browser are limited to protect the user's safety.
The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from accessing private information or harming the user's data.
Examples of such restrictions include:
- JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs.
It has no direct access to OS functions.
Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is limited and only provided if the user does certain actions, like "dropping" a file into a browser window or selecting it via an `<input>` tag.
There are ways to interact with the camera/microphone and other devices, but they require a user's explicit permission.
So a JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a web-camera, observe the surroundings and send the information to the [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency).
- Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other.
Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript to open the other one.
But even in this case, JavaScript from one page may not access the other page if they come from different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).
This is called the "Same Origin Policy".
To work around that, *both pages* must agree for data exchange and must contain special JavaScript code that handles it.
We'll cover that in the tutorial.
This limitation is, again, for the user's safety.
A page from `http://anysite.com` which a user has opened must not be able to access another browser tab with the URL `http://gmail.com`, for example, and steal information from there.
- JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from.
But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled.
Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side.
Once again, that's a safety limitation.
Such limitations do not exist if JavaScript is used outside of the browser, for example on a server.
Modern browsers also allow plugins/extensions which may ask for extended permissions.
## What makes JavaScript unique?
There are at least *three* great things about JavaScript:
+ Full integration with HTML/CSS.
+ Simple things are done simply.
+ Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.
JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.
That's what makes JavaScript unique.
That's why it's the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.
That said, JavaScript can be used to create servers, mobile applications, etc.
## Languages "over" JavaScript
The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone's needs.
Different people want different features.
That's to be expected, because projects and requirements are different for everyone.
So, recently a plethora of new languages appeared, which are *transpiled* (converted) to JavaScript before they run in the browser.
Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent, actually allowing developers to code in another language and auto-converting it "under the hood".
Examples of such languages:
- [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) is "syntactic sugar" for JavaScript.
It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write clearer and more precise code.
Usually, Ruby devs like it.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is concentrated on adding "strict data typing" to simplify the development and support of complex systems.
It is developed by Microsoft.
- [Flow](https://flow.org/) also adds data typing, but in a different way.
Developed by Facebook.
- [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) is a standalone language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile apps), but also can be transpiled to JavaScript.
Developed by Google.
- [Brython](https://brython.info/) is a Python transpiler to JavaScript that enables the writing of applications in pure Python without JavaScript.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html) is a modern, concise and safe programming language that can target the browser or Node.
There are more.
Of course, even if we use one of these transpiled languages, we should also know JavaScript to really understand what we're doing.
## Summary
- JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments as well.
- Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language, fully integrated with HTML/CSS.
- There are many languages that get "transpiled" to JavaScript and provide certain features.
It is recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.
# Manuals and specifications
This book is a *tutorial*.
It aims to help you gradually learn the language.
But once you're familiar with the basics, you'll need other resources.
## Specification
[The ECMA-262 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript.
It defines the language.
But being that formalized, it's difficult to understand at first.
So if you need the most trustworthy source of information about the language details, the specification is the right place.
But it's not for everyday use.
A new specification version is released every year.
Between these releases, the latest specification draft is at <https://tc39.es/ecma262/>.
To read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are "almost standard" (so-called "stage 3"), see proposals at <https://github.com/tc39/proposals>.
Also, if you're developing for the browser, then there are other specifications covered in the [second part](info:browser-environment) of the tutorial.
## Manuals
- **MDN (Mozilla) JavaScript Reference** is the main manual with examples and other information.
It's great to get in-depth information about individual language functions, methods etc.
    You can find it at <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference>.
Although, it's often best to use an internet search instead.
Just use "MDN [term]" in the query, e.g. <https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt> to search for the `parseInt` function.
## Compatibility tables
JavaScript is a developing language, new features get added regularly.
To see their support among browser-based and other engines, see:
- <https://caniuse.com> - per-feature tables of support, e.g. to see which engines support modern cryptography functions: <https://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography>.
- <https://kangax.github.io/compat-table> - a table with language features and engines that support those or don't support.
All these resources are useful in real-life development, as they contain valuable information about language details, their support, etc.
Please remember them (or this page) for the cases when you need in-depth information about a particular feature.
# Code editors
A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.
There are two main types of code editors: IDEs and lightweight editors.
Many people use one tool of each type.
## IDE
The term [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a "whole project."
As the name suggests, it's not just an editor, but a full-scale "development environment."
An IDE loads the project (which can be many files), allows navigation between files, provides autocompletion based on the whole project (not just the open file), and integrates with a version management system (like [git](https://git-scm.com/)), a testing environment, and other "project-level" stuff.
If you haven't selected an IDE yet, consider the following options:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform, free).
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (cross-platform, paid).
For Windows, there's also "Visual Studio", not to be confused with "Visual Studio Code".
"Visual Studio" is a paid and mighty Windows-only editor, well-suited for the .NET platform.
It's also good at JavaScript.
There's also a free version [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).
Many IDEs are paid, but have a trial period.
Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer's salary, so just choose the best one for you.
## Lightweight editors
"Lightweight editors" are not as powerful as IDEs, but they're fast, elegant and simple.
They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.
The main difference between a "lightweight editor" and an "IDE" is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on.
A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.
In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there's no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.
There are many options, for instance:
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (cross-platform, shareware).
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows, free).
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are also cool if you know how to use them.
## Let's not argue
The editors in the lists above are those that either I or my friends whom I consider good developers have been using for a long time and are happy with.
There are other great editors in our big world.
Please choose the one you like the most.
The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habits, and personal preferences.
The author's personal opinion:
- I'd use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if I develop mostly frontend.
- Otherwise, if it's mostly another language/platform and partially frontend, then consider other editors, such as XCode (Mac), Visual Studio (Windows) or Jetbrains family (Webstorm, PHPStorm, RubyMine etc, depending on the language).
# Developer console
Code is prone to errors.
You will quite likely make errors...
Oh, what am I talking about?
You are *absolutely* going to make errors, at least if you're a human, not a [robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama)).
But in the browser, users don't see errors by default.
So, if something goes wrong in the script, we won't see what's broken and can't fix it.
To see errors and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, "developer tools" have been embedded in browsers.
Most developers lean towards Chrome or Firefox for development because those browsers have the best developer tools.
Other browsers also provide developer tools, sometimes with special features, but are usually playing "catch-up" to Chrome or Firefox.
So most developers have a "favorite" browser and switch to others if a problem is browser-specific.
Developer tools are potent; they have many features.
To start, we'll learn how to open them, look at errors, and run JavaScript commands.
## Google Chrome
Open the page [bug.html](bug.html).
There's an error in the JavaScript code on it.
It's hidden from a regular visitor's eyes, so let's open developer tools to see it.
Press `key:F12` or, if you're on Mac, then `key:Cmd+Opt+J`.
The developer tools will open on the Console tab by default.
It looks somewhat like this:
The exact look of developer tools depends on your version of Chrome.
It changes from time to time but should be similar.
- Here we can see the red-colored error message.
In this case, the script contains an unknown "lalala" command.
- On the right, there is a clickable link to the source `bug.html:12` with the line number where the error has occurred.
Below the error message, there is a blue `>` symbol.
It marks a "command line" where we can type JavaScript commands.
Press `key:Enter` to run them.
Now we can see errors, and that's enough for a start.
We'll come back to developer tools later and cover debugging more in-depth in the chapter <info:debugging-chrome>.
```smart header="Multi-line input"
Usually, when we put a line of code into the console, and then press `key:Enter`, it executes.
To insert multiple lines, press `key:Shift+Enter`.
This way one can enter long fragments of JavaScript code.
```
## Firefox, Edge, and others
Most other browsers use `key:F12` to open developer tools.
The look & feel of them is quite similar.
Once you know how to use one of these tools (you can start with Chrome), you can easily switch to another.
## Safari
Safari (Mac browser, not supported by Windows/Linux) is a little bit special here.
We need to enable the "Develop menu" first.
Open Preferences and go to the "Advanced" pane.
There's a checkbox at the bottom:
Now `key:Cmd+Opt+C` can toggle the console.
Also, note that the new top menu item named "Develop" has appeared.
It has many commands and options.
## Summary
- Developer tools allow us to see errors, run commands, examine variables, and much more.
- They can be opened with `key:F12` for most browsers on Windows.
Chrome for Mac needs `key:Cmd+Opt+J`, Safari: `key:Cmd+Opt+C` (need to enable first).
Now we have the environment ready.
In the next section, we'll get down to JavaScript.
# Hello, world!
This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself.
But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is a good choice.
We'll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like `alert`) to a minimum so that you don't spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node.js).
We'll focus on JavaScript in the browser in the [next part](/ui) of the tutorial.
So first, let's see how we attach a script to a webpage.
For server-side environments (like Node.js), you can execute the script with a command like `"node my.js"`.
## The "script" tag
JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the `<script>` tag.
For instance:
You can run the example by clicking the "Play" button in the right-top corner of the box above.
```
The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.
## Modern markup
The `<script>` tag has a few attributes that are rarely used nowadays but can still be found in old code:
The `type` attribute: <code>&lt;script <u>type</u>=...&gt;</code>
: The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a `type`.
Usually it was `type="text/javascript"`.
It's not required anymore.
Also, the modern HTML standard totally changed the meaning of this attribute.
Now, it can be used for JavaScript modules.
But that's an advanced topic, we'll talk about modules in another part of the tutorial.
The `language` attribute: <code>&lt;script <u>language</u>=...&gt;</code>
: This attribute was meant to show the language of the script.
This attribute no longer makes sense because JavaScript is the default language.
There is no need to use it.
Comments before and after scripts.
: In really ancient books and guides, you may find comments inside `<script>` tags, like this:
    This trick isn't used in modern JavaScript.
These comments hide JavaScript code from old browsers that didn't know how to process the `<script>` tag.
Since browsers released in the last 15 years don't have this issue, this kind of comment can help you identify really old code.
## External scripts
If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.
Script files are attached to HTML with the `src` attribute:
Here, `/path/to/script.js` is an absolute path to the script from the site root.
One can also provide a relative path from the current page.
For instance, `src="script.js"`, just like `src="./script.js"`, would mean a file `"script.js"` in the current folder.
We can give a full URL as well.
For instance:
To attach several scripts, use multiple tags:
As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML.
More complex ones reside in separate files.
The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache).
Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.
That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.
```
````warn header="If `src` is set, the script content is ignored."
A single `<script>` tag can't have both the `src` attribute and code inside.
This won't work:
We must choose either an external `<script src="…">` or a regular `<script>` with code.
The example above can be split into two scripts to work:
## Summary
- We can use a `<script>` tag to add JavaScript code to a page.
- The `type` and `language` attributes are not required.
- A script in an external file can be inserted with `<script src="path/to/script.js"></script>`.
There is much more to learn about browser scripts and their interaction with the webpage.
But let's keep in mind that this part of the tutorial is devoted to the JavaScript language, so we shouldn't distract ourselves with browser-specific implementations of it.
We'll be using the browser as a way to run JavaScript, which is very convenient for online reading, but only one of many.
---
# Show an alert
Create a page that shows a message "I'm JavaScript!".
Do it in a sandbox, or on your hard drive, doesn't matter, just ensure that it works.
---
# Show an alert with an external script
Take the solution of the previous task <info:task/hello-alert>.
Modify it by extracting the script content into an external file `alert.js`, residing in the same folder.
Open the page, ensure that the alert works.
